I had previously used `streams` in my code already so what should I do for this level? I noticed that if I make a branch but no edits, I can't make a pull request to my own repo? Is this the case or did I do something wrong in my steps.

Steps I did:

1. Open SourseTree & branch from master
1. Right click `branch-A-Streams` and select `Create pull request...`
1. Redirects me to the website

1. Change base repo to my own

1. The `Create pull request` part disappeared

Can I just add a branch and add a tag for this level if there is nothing to do?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: A-Assertions**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/177" expanded>

I have attempted this and found out that `assert` throws an `AssertionException`, and this causes errors in my unit testing as I expect my own exceptions (the `DukeException` that we made) to be thrown.

Any tips on what to do in this case? Such as making gradle's test to ignore `AssertionException`?

From the notes it mentioned that `assert` is __disabled__ by default on `java` and we need to use a `-ea` flag to activate it so I wonder if it is the same case for testing? Or should I just remove those `assert` that interferes with my own exception throwing?

Also, any suggestions on how many `assert` to add? Or this level is just to let us get familiar with it so any number is ok?

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: ScnenBuilder uses JavaFX 16**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/159" expanded>

Following the tutorial, it asks us to use JavaFX 11. However, SceneBuilder seems to be using JavaFX 16 instead, and hence always shows a lot of warning messages when I run my program.

Currently I found a fix which is to manually edit the fxml files generated by ScnenBuilder to switch it to JavaFX 11. Is there any easier way such as telling SceneBuilder to use JavaFX11 instead? Or can we use JavaFX 16 in our project?

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Jar file cannot run**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/143" expanded>

So after completing the GUI I thought it will be nice to have a jar file for it. So I ran the `shadowJar` function in gradle but the jar file it produced does not work. The program is able to run on Intelij, and shadowJar is able to work when I disabled the GUI.

As the screenshot suggests, somehow `shadowJar` did not pack my `javafx` stuffs into the `jar` file? Any fix for this?

I suspect that it is because I shifted `Duke.java` into `duke` package, hence i modified `runtest.bat` abit at line 10
`javac  -cp ..\src\main\java\duke -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\duke\*.java`
Now I'm getting these errors and idk how to proceed on, some kind souls enlighten me pls tyvm.

I have already commited but all I wrote for the commit message is just "Level X completed". I'm new to using soursetree so I thought the message is just to tell myself what the commit is about. Also I tend to only commit once for each level is that supposed to be the case?

If you are afraid of this then one way you can do is probably add a `Main.java` to hold that `main()` function which calls
`new Duke()`. But as far as I know this is fine, with the variables set to `private`. Constructor can be left `public` actually.

I tried using cmd also but it's the same results. From what I recall i think there is a way to call `javac` on the `.java` files in the subdirectories also right? I believe the issue here is just that only `Duke.java` is being processed and hence it can't find the other files/classes

`javac com/vistas/util/*.java com/vistas/converter/*.java com.vistas.LineHelper/*.java com/current/mdcontect/*.java`

I would say that's the easy way, which is wut I did, is to just overwrite the file. Imo, the more efficient way is to only write to the file before the program ends, whether normally or due to some exceptions.

I'm not sure if there is a way to just remove some lines from a text file, most of the time people would just read the file and filter the list and output it.

I believe you are testing for the load and save function. What I did is that I have a `data.txt` which is already filled with some stuff to test my `load()`, after which follows normal testing and lastly, delete all tasks in the list (can also test delete during this time) and add back the tasks that was initially in `data.txt`.

Hence if my `store()` is working correctly, the 2nd round of script should still show `no diff` for `FC`. (sadly u still need to run the script manually)

Update: actually now I thought again, why not duplicate the content of the script so it runs twice?

`dir /s /B  ../src/main/java/*/*.java` didnt work for me I had to do it the other way sadly. Also, using `dir` gives the absolute path which `javac` cannot use if it contains `space bar` if im not wrong. Can also refer to mine if you face the same issue as me #52.

It removes the first part of the absolute path. Using `dir ..\src\main\java\duke /s /b /a-d > sources_raw.txt`, I'm getting
```
D:\Downloads\IntelliJ IDEA\IdeaProjects\ip\src\main\java\duke\Duke.java

`set "line=!line:IDEA\IdeaProjects\ip=..!"` is like performing a string replacement and make it all into

You can remove the line and use absolute path if it does not contain white space like me `...\IntelliJ IDEA\...`

Firstly, I think your method is not returning if an exception is thrown
```
public String getKeyword() {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            **return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();**
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }

    // Here
    }
```
So if any errors are thrown, the catch part will be executed. And then the program proceeds to the part marks `Here`, so you still need a `return` statement there I suppose. You can try this out.

Usually when I want to handle the error in the current function, I will use a `try... catch...`, but if I wan the parent function (the function that calls `getKeyword()`) to handle that error, use the `public String getKeyword() throw Exception`.

From my experience working in a small 2 people group project, we discussed the main features that are to implement and together, we come up with a `Main` first. The `Main` will handle all the transitions between the methods and stuffs. From there on, we try to develop features to add on to `Main`, but are independent of existing features. In another word, we try to split the work such that we do not need to resolve major merge conflicts. The only conflicts that can possibly arise is in `Main`

My experience with the given gradle is just merge it to my main and change the `mainclass`, which you showed, and it works just fine. In my case, my `main` is in `Duke.java` which is `src/main/java/duke/Duke`, and i set it to `mainclass = 'duke.Duke'`

Thanks for the reply, it works!

Regarding this, 
> does show that it is necessary to create an additional `Launcher` class to avoid any circular dependencies

I did not see in the docs that a `Launcher` class is required to avoid circular dependencies tho. Maybe you are referring to the comment `A launcher class to workaround classpath issues.`? Not sure what exactly is a `classpath issue`.

I thought that my `Main` can just call the `main` method to launch the app. Maybe it is because `Main.main()` calls `launch` which in turn call another `new Main()`, hence the circular dependencies? This also explains why we need to just create an empty constructor for people have the other issues?

Also I think when I copied the `.xml` files from AB3 both showed some errors and I had to resolve them first before my checkstyle can run. Perhaps take a look into the 2 `.xml` files and see if Intelij shows any errors? The part that show error for me is line 3-4.

I think I did not change the checkstyle much apart from small changes to the rules and auto formatting done by Intelij. But glad that it works.

Things I changed:

1. Change `ignoreFinal` from `false` to `true` to allow constant variable to be named with all caps
``` xml
&gt;!-- Validate abbreviations (consecutive capital letters) length in identifier name -->
		<module name = "AbbreviationAsWordInName">
			<property name = "ignoreFinal" value = "true"/>
			<property name = "allowedAbbreviationLength" value = "1"/>
		</module>
```

2. Remove check for `(` as it affects lambda expressions `() -&gt; ...`
``` xml
<module name = "SeparatorWrap">
			&gt;!-- Checks that the ",", "]", "[", "...", ";" is at the previous end of line in a line wrap. -->
			<property name = "tokens" value = "COMMA, RBRACK, ARRAY_DECLARATOR, ELLIPSIS, SEMI"/>

Can't really find some places to insert `assert` as most of the places Intelij will highlight it as `unreachable code` or `the boolean is always true` kind of stuffs due to `exception` handling the cases, but I managed to put it somewhere in my codes... I hope they are fine with just 1 `assert`...

That's an interesting idea. What I put in my code currently is to ensure that the list of tasks to be saved to local storage cannot be `null`, although inside my code this technically will never happen. I guess I'm treating `assert` as some ways to double check.

Text ui testing may not be applicable if you have not update the input.txt and expected.txt in them. Also packaging will cause an error in the scripts if you do not change them. 

I wonder if there is a way to let CI to run the Junit tests instead? I believe that is more helpful than the text ui testing.

I guess in a sense, accepting a pull request is like performing a merge branch on GitHub. Hence after the operation and resolving merge conflicts, the things from the pull request are merged into your master (or other branch you merging to). Hence in SourceTree it shows as if you performed a merge branch.

Personally, after I accept my pull request, my SourceTree updates to some what similar to yours after I call for a pull request on my master to see the update.

Once I remove them from your build.gradle, it is able to get the test files (even though it says all the junit test are not found).

I think your test statement imports are wrong. They should be

Hi all, I am unable to see the AB3 save file in the directory that the AB3.jar is located in as explained by [this guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html#saving-the-data) 

I have turned on hidden files and even tried to check the contents of the jar using `jar -tf addressbook.jar | grep -r addressbook.json` and couldn't get anything.

Hi all, just wanted to check if it is necessary to test functions that are inherited from a super class. IMO it makes sense to just test the super class, and if it fails, we should expect the same test to fail for the child class(therefore unnecessary). The exception to this is if the child class overrides this method, and since it differs from its parent, should also be tested.

I have 2 branches A and B. I have worked on branch A making commits to it and finished a feature. I am now on branch B, where I realised some of the files on branch A share identical logic which I can just copy over. How can I bring over certain lines for these files? 

From what I understand, cherrypicking in git is for whole commits, but since branch B only requires  **specific code** in **specific files** I am not sure what is a good way to do this.

For more context this is because, level-7 introduces a subclass that level-8 can use ! And just copy pasting it over feels wrong

Hi all, adding new tasks to the data file is a simple write with an append option to a file. Whilst an operation like delete or complete task requires you to somehow search the file and amend/ delete the line.

One way I could think of is to rewrite the whole file with all the tasks that are still in the list when delete/ complete a task is called, but this seems to inefficient. Thoughts?

Should we immediately be encapsulating methods that are related into a class? I have just completed Level-2 of the iP and logic for the ToDo list is in the main function.

By doing so, I can foresee some "wasted" effort if in the next few levels(which I think is meant to simulate SDLC iterations), there is changing requirements.

This is interesting and unexpected. The temp file is committed sometime in the past(we shall call this point A) and only ignored later(Point B), so git doesn't use the .gitignore at Point A and show the temp file at Point A? So only the latest .gitignore file is always used when checking out files?

If it is your most recent commit, you can try `git commit --amend  &gt;Newmessage>` or `git commit --amend` if you want to open an editor to write the message.

I am not too sure for older commits, but I think using Intellij or SourceTree would be easier for much older commits

Hi ricky, I did a quick search and found the following

1. 
> branch.*.remote configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to origin.

Git push origin is more specific and I am assuming would allow you to specify other branches that you would like to push to your remote repository, not necessarily the branch you are currently on.
[git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) 

2. When you clone a repository, the repo that you clone from would be added as a remote repo and for convenience be named as origin for a shorthand. Therefore at this point, in the mod, we would usually be working with origin as we are working on our own repo. 
Use `git remote -v` to see the link between the shorthand "origin" and the URL of your repo

[git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone#:~:text=git%20clone%20is%20primarily%20used,copies%20an%20existing%20Git%20repository.)

@huizhuansam Will check it out!

@SkyBlaise99 I think for this iP that would be the obvious choice, but this will probably me more applicable if the code implemented in A was a major feature that is not ready to be merged with B, especially since I only need some common code from A to be in B and not all of it.

@sueann-chua Not really following this thread but for git branching, including the -b flag means that you are trying to create a branch and then perform a checkout. I am assuming you are trying to checkout an existing branch so use

Hi Jia Rong, from the sounds of it you have merged add-gradle-support into your branch.

Do you have a package called seedu? Since the build.gradle file was meant to have a package structure `seedu > duke > Duke`, if you don't follow this it would cause an error.

Could you check your `<project root dir>/build.gradle` and under `application`change `mainClassName`to somePackage.another.Mainclass. I have included an example below.

@waynetee My current implementation implements the methods directly into the commands as I find a solution to this. 

Because of the same method signature and return type of the getSyntax method, I thought it would be better to put it in the parent class to ensure that future commands are checked by the compiler to ensure the method is implemented.

Ok I think this is the cause of the problem. You are making a shallow copy of taskList, this means that all your taskLists are pointed to the same arrayList instance.

for example:
ArrayList: [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]

taskList -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]
taskListCpy -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB, ElemC]  (Which is the same 3 elments!)

if I do taskListCpy delete index 2
taskListCpy -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB] 
taskList -&gt; ArrayList -&gt; [ElemA, ElemB]


Solution: Make a deep copy! Do something like a for loop that create new instances of each task in the taskList and return a new taskList

It's pretty interesting that you are running this on wsl.

I suspect it's hard for intelij to pipe your input all the way to the wsl process.

Perhaps you can try `./gradlew run` on the wsl terminal and see if it works.

Later on, you might run into further problems when you start adding a gui on wsl.

Unless you are confident to proceed, can I suggest you use windows instead? Perhaps this would be the easier way out. :)

You can remove the stroke related properties you are not using.

As a general tip, to debug performance-related issues, you can try to binary search the bug. Delete half your code or half the fxml file and see if the issue persists, then continue to narrow down the search range until you find the exact location of the issue.

I believe you need the branch, pushing the tag wont be enough. The marking script seems to checking for the branch in this case. 
If you havent committed yet, I think you can still check out now to a new branch without much issue.

From what I understand from some people that have worked in a software company, you can commit it on a branch for the feature you are working on and just write WIP and a description about what you are doing to indicate its still incomplete 😄

I think its just more to confirm some stuff. Maybe you can change some void functions to return true or false to indicate if it is executed correctly. Not very sure if this is advisable though.

Otherwise, you can use overloading to implement compareTask function in task. 
 
Ie. have compareTask(Event, Deadline) and compareTask(Deadline, Deadline) etc. 
So if its Event vs Deadline then you compare the time. 
If its Todo vs Deadline then you just return toDo. 

Still think @XXJJXJ's solution is the best haha. Since you have to implement for many different permutations and if another class of Task is added you have to add even more. 

By the way, you can't use generics for this since it's meant for things like ArrayList Hashmap and so on. Maybe you are thinking about how Event are subclass of Task and hence can be passed into the function that takes in Task. 😄

I don't think we should be asserting trivial stuff but the above may not be minor if there's a chance that your code will actually result in passing null to add. If there isn't then perhaps its a bit unecessary. 

I actually used assert for my filemanager, if the way the file was formatted was actually different from what is expected. This would be a genuine error on my part for not loading the file properly and hence assertions were quite useful here. 😄 Hopefully this helps!

Mmmm if we are following CS2030s way, I think a better way would be to use a "of" static method to check if the input is valid before passing it into the constructor. 

I guess you don't want to add things or initialise stuff before realising the following steps will throw exceptions. Not very sure though haha.

@SkyBlaise99 On that note, I also used assert to double check that the format of my file that tasks are saved to is right. Eg if it assumes that each task should be prefixed with its type, it will throw an error if the first word isnt a task type. Maybe this could work?

Unless you are consistently using this as a separator I don't think so. 

This means that for example your tasks are always seperated by ", " in your file saved. Then you will use it in more than one instance (when accessing it and when saving it). Then maybe it's worth replacing just in case you change it in one instance but not the other.

No idea if im sprouting nonsense but maybe you can just implement the method in the command class then inside you just assert fail? then in the other command classes you can override it? 

this kind of sacrifices the advantage of inheritance though I feel, because future programmers might not realise that you need to override until they run it. 

Alternatively, just give up on the static part HAHAHA

correct me if wrong, just like final int[] arr = {1,1,1}, you can still modify the element in the array, but you can't assign a new array {1,2,2} to arr since arr is final. so storage is ok to be final

Wish to check on how do I write such tests? For example, in my case, creating an instance of object A may throw error 1 or error 2. 

Assuming that in my test that I wrote, if I supply the correct inputs in the instantiation, no exceptions will be thrown and hence what should I include in the catch block in my test class?
However, if I supply 1 erroneous input which will cause either error 1 or error 2, what do I include in the expected outcome in the assertEquals(expected, actual) method in the try block in the test class?

Hi all,
Small doubt. When I simply click a jar file and attempt to open it, java assertions are disabled by default.
This means that one of the error handling mechanisms I have in place is not active.

however, when the jar file is opened from the terminal or command line with assertions activated, everything works fine.
is this acceptable?

Finally, I use a Mac, and I have no issues opening the jar file on my system. However, a friend of mine was unable to open the file on her computer due to her jvm being older than version 58. Is it necessary for me to do something to make the jar file compatible?

if so, what can I do?

Hi all,

I tried to reorganise my code upon the addition of gradle.
I created a test folder under <src/main> subdirectory and marked it as a test sources root.
I moved my ParserTest class to this folder from the duke package (where it was previously).

The screenshot below indicates part of the folder structure and my ParserTest class.
<img width="1792" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-03 at 6 45 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64624151/131993750-ff3db377-3081-4084-aff6-efe02736a692.png">

However, whenever I try to run the class, the tests do not run and a message (as seen in the screenshot) saying "No tasks available" shows. Furthermore when I try to run the tests from the gradle menu on the side, the same result is observed.

My build.gradle has the following code (which I believe is sufficient to run tests): -
```
test {
    useJUnitPlatform()

    testLogging {
        events "passed", "skipped", "failed"

        showExceptions true
        exceptionFormat "full"
        showCauses true
        showStackTraces true
        showStandardStreams = false
    }
}
```

Any suggestions on how to rectify this?

Hi all,
I have tried to use an assert statement to check that my command is a valid command.

```
To test, I enter invalid commands such as "smt", "gbg" etc, and on my console I see that the variable valid always prints as "false" (as it should). However, the code should not even reach this statement, the exception should be thrown as a result of the assert statement just prior. I have enabled assertions in build.gradle already with the following code.

```
run {
    enableAssertions = true
} 
```

Why am I not seeing an exception?

Hi,
I followed all the instructions provided in the docs.
I have tried manually inputting the test commands, and see no issue in the outputs.
As such, I copied these outputs directly from the terminal and pasted them in my EXPECTED.txt file.
The corresponding inputs are in my input.txt file.

However, when I run the .sh script, I see the tests fail and the actual.txt file only shows a fraction of the output that should be seen.
I also see some kind of error "dos2unix command not found" pertaining to a command in the .sh file, in the terminal window.
I have included screenshots of my actual.txt, input.txt, expected.txt, and my terminal upon running the script.
Kindly help me resolve this issue.

Unfortunately running into a similar issue again.

```
    public static String interpretInput(String input, List<Task> tasks) throws DukeException {

                response = doneResponse(input, tasks);
            } else if (input.startsWith(addWhiteSpace(TODO_STRING))

            } else if (input.startsWith("find ")) {
                response = findResponse(input, tasks);
            } else if (input.startsWith("sort events and deadlines")
                    || input.startsWith("sort deadlines and events")) {

        writeToStorage(tasks);
        System.out.println(response);
        return response;
    }
```

The function above is for the same purpose of interpreting the user's input.
However, when I enter invalid commands, the exception is not caught (and I assume it is not thrown either).
The print statement for the variable valid always yields false when an incorrect command is entered.

My build.gradle has

Turns out the issue recurred only in my jar file.
It is working fine now. Enabling assertions from the terminal when opening the jar file allows me to see the assertion thrown. 

Just to confirm, if you click the JAR file and open the bot, you're not expected to see assertions thrown, right? Seeing as assertions are disabled by default?

gradle shadowJar through the command line when inside my IDE

Not sure what difference it would make but I tried ./gradlew shadowJar as well

Tried gradle clean before gradle shadowJar
Tried ./gradlew clean shadowJar too

Another thing is, now the error message is that my jar file is of version 59.0 instead of 58.0... (see picture below)
I haven't changed any settings...
Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but I have the premium version of intellij (free for students)

I heard the saying that you should commit whenever your software is at a stage where it is worth being remembered as a version.
But i have this question:
suppose i write a whole lot of code already for the entire day but then at the end of the day the code is   still incomplete or in need of a clean up. Should i not commit? What happens if i don't commit and then my com just suddenly dies(you never know what can happen)?  My whole day's work would be gone! 
so even if I do local commit and my com dies, it still dies with my com so to play safe i should push to remote branch every time (but then again the code currently is not exactly a version worth remembering)?

My understanding is that you can reference fxml elements from control classes, <ins>but can you also reference them from say Duke.java which is not a control class for any element.<ins>

control classes are those classes where `fxmlLoader.setController(this)`, `fxmlLoader.setRoot(this)`, etc. has been called

What i mean by reference is like calling functions to modify fxml element's properties 
e.g.
```java
//scrollPane & dialogContainer are fxml elements
scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty());
dialogContainer.getChildren().add(
       DialogBox.getDukeDialog("Welcome! What can i do for you?", dukeImage)

The latter sounds like an extremely bad practice, as i have heard from online forums.

    1. create new branch locally
    2. after a commit on that branch, push it to a remote branch 
    3. make a pull request to master 
    4. merge into master
    5. at local master use git pull to update my local files

Is this correct?

Raising this issue to see if there are good ways to implement the following:

I'm trying to implement sort functionality by adding a `compareTo` method in my `Task` class. Inside this method, I saw duplicated code for my `Event` and `Deadline` classes and tried to extract this out to a `compareDateTime` method.

The issue is that instance variables `date` /`time` are specific to `Event`/`Deadline` classes only and not to `Task` and therefore casting is needed. But I'm not sure how to do this :(

Using generics crossed my mind, but my 2030S knowledge has failed me in my hour of need 😫

> TLDR: `compareDateTime` accepts either 2 `Event` or `Deadline` objects. They need to be cast accordingly to access their variables.

I agree. If I understand right, for a fast forward merge to occur, the latest commit of the branch being merged into must be an ancestor in the history of the other branch. 
Since `C4` is a new commit on `master` not within the history of `coolfeature` branch, this should a rebasing.

A quick google search shows that developers in general seem to be divided on this haha. One possible reason for using the imperative tense is that from the POV of a code reviewer/approver, the message will imply what will happen after merge.

I'm shifting towards the imperative, because it helps me keep it short and be more precise. Regardless of what you like, I think what's important is to maintain consistency in tense within a project.

Try out marcus' link, I'll just give a high level view of what needs to be done:

 - Checkout a new branch (Now both master and newbranch are at the latest commit)
 - Move the master branch pointer HEAD back by n commits (Now master is outdated and only newbranch has the new commits)
 - Checkout master and force push to remote (The force push is required if your remote master is already updated to the later commits)
 - Checkout newbranch, set upstream and push

I'd say it depends on factors like;
 - how long you are working on a separate branch
 - how much overlap your work will have with other developers' work (if files you are significantly changing are being significantly changed on master at the same time)
 
So far, I've found it enough to focus on my work and once the pull request is created, I will update my branch with all the latest changes from master. Yet I do keep an eye on ongoing changes to ensure no major conflicts will arise as a result of not updating my branch, and if so an occasional pull works best!

The PR would usually show this and you can update your branch then:

But its definitely better to follow @HolmesJJ advice if files you work on are more subject to frequent (significant) change on the master simultaneously.
ie. other developers are working on features involving the same files (which usually isn't the most efficient way to divide work)

To answer OP's question, I initially tried to use the `Thread.sleep()` as well as a `Timer` class. It did not work as expected because it caused the program to sleep immediately preventing the previous lines of code which showed the bye message to run and display on the GUI.

Instead, I ended up using `CompletableFuture` as shown in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58707945/10996783) stackoverflow answer!

Yeah seems like I will have to modify my OOP implementation like @XXJJXJ mentioned. Thanks @yucheng11122017 for explaining why generics is not applicable!

@SkyBlaise99 we seem to be doing it in a very similar way haha but I've allowed Events and Deadlines to have an optional Time value. This introduces the additional chunk of duplicated code which would go inside the ternary op you used.

In the sense, since ToDo doesn't have date time, I didn't make them part of the Task class -&gt; Separate casting required for each.

Its exactly like your ternary op [here](https://github.com/SkyBlaise99/ip/blob/1100320edd2a9338c3727a16d929aaf9699fdea7/src/main/java/sora/task/Task.java#L100). I just have a lot more duplicated code similar to your `.extractDateTime` call in both the consequent and alternative.

Yes, your new implementation was what I was planning to go ahead with. I'm not sure if [this](https://github.com/SkyBlaise99/ip/blob/1ac685b0f7e6b71a03f56588241af4cb8d618e8e/src/main/java/sora/task/Todo.java#L21) is a good way since I don't want my ToDo class to have anything to do with date, time.

I might also just implement `compareTo` separately in the Event and Deadline classes. Seems simpler and OOP-friendly as well.

Hi  @wengYing227,

I cloned your project and got it running by;

1. Setting `mainClassName` to `Launcher`
2. Overloading the Duke constructor with one that takes in no parameters (You can implement this as you like it though)

Let me know if you run into errors doing the above!

Sidenote: Might be a good idea to add exception handling when loading the task file :)

Hi Rishabh, 

Not exactly a solution but I've gotten this exact exception a couple of times. I usually focus on fixing the errors beneath this one, after which this does not show up (at least not yet). For example, from the snippet shown, try fixing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (You can select the exception and run with --scan for more details, which I found helpful).

I assume the `InvocationTargetException` is a result of exceptions propagating out of Duke to the GUI segments.

The whole program runs well on IDEA,
however, after I generated a jar file and double-clicked duke.jar to run the program, a problem occurs.

Hi everyone,

Not sure if this is exactly a tip, but just added knowledge that I thought could be interesting to share.

Currently we are doing Unit testing, which requires us to manually create test functions which can take a ton of time and work. Wouldn't it be better to have some toolkit to be able to automatically create test cases for us? 

There are a couple already in development and can be used, here's one which I've used before: 
- [EvoSuite](https://www.evosuite.org/)

There is also a guide on how you can set it up on intelliJ.
https://www.evosuite.org/documentation/intellij-idea-plugin/

or if you prefer to have video guide on understanding what EvoSuite brings, here's a couple of youtube videos on it:
1. [Automatically generate JUnit test cases using EvoSuite tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0K6VGhqbqg&ab_channel=ShabbirAbdul)
2. [Advanced Software Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv4DD9SpVeo&ab_channel=JanikValentin)

Automatic Test Generation from what I understand, isn't yet entirely perfect but can be a good way to alleviate burden on creating test cases.

EvoSuite isn't the only one, there are also a couple out there in the industry as well such as:
- [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/)

Randoop also creates automatic test cases but also in Junit Format.

I'm not exactly sure if we are allowed to use automatic test generators for our project in this module. Perhaps Prof @damithc could add in. But nonetheless I hope this can be a helpful toolkit for your future projects.

Hi, not sure if you've noticed yet but that IntelliJ has their own built-in Git Capability. Though nothing wrong using SourceTree and command line.

Hi @huizhuansam, if we think about JSON in itself, the keys and value are in a form of some objects type (for example,String,integer) and an array. Thus, defintely Java does support it, and there are a wide array of third-party libraries we can use. 
you can refer more here: 
https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/json.html

One third-party library I used before was this: 
https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/

Also, to your question about other formats besides JSON, we can actually make use of comma-seperated values (or .CSV), which can easily be converted to excel sheets. Also, instead of comma-seperated values, we can also consider, tabbed-seperated values (using the '\t' to split the values apart). So, JSON isn't the only way.

I hope this helps. 👍🏽

Perhaps the link below could be of help:

The last EvoSuite has been updated was a year ago, so perhaps it might have issues deadling with the latest IntelliJ software. You could also try using the commandline if you prefer, or take a look at Randoop too.

Hi @jiarong15,

there is plenty of ways to test exceptions in this case besides using assertEquals().

Some ways, we can test exception:

1. You can use assertThrows, for example: 

```
// expecting an Exception to be thrown when initialising Object A

assertThrows(Exception.class, () ->
            { 
                 Object A = new Object();
            });
```

2. Using try, catch and assertTrue:

```
try{
        Object A = new Object();
        boolean caught = false;

        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
             caught = true;
            // true if NullPointerException is caught, otherwise show message
            //assertTrue(caught, "null pointer exception NOT thrown");
            
        } catch (SomeOtherException e1) {
             caught = true;
           // true if SomeOtherException is caught, otherwise show message
            assertTrue(caught, "exception NOT thrown");
        }
```

> Assuming that in my test that I wrote, if I supply the correct inputs in the instantiation, no exceptions will be thrown and hence what should I include in the catch block in my test class?

My view on this would then be to create a method and not use a try catch and use the throws keyword on the method signature. Given that you ensured your inputs are correct.

There are many other assert methods besides `assertEquals()` that can help in your test cases.

I hope this helps.

Hi @hungkhoaitay, 

Check to ensure you have this: 

1. Launcher Class that runs your Duke Class 
2. your Duke class should be the one where `Duke extends Application`
3. In intellIJ -&gt; check your external libraries that JavaFX libraries is installed (Do so by going `Project Settings -&gt; Libraries`)
4. Also check your javaFX libraries are in your module dependencies, like the image below: 
![Screenshot 2021-09-02 at 1 31 08 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22881285/131787366-775ac3b0-5a8d-4b90-b81d-67ce084c330d.png)


A possible issue even if you have resolve the above, is if you have a module-info.java file, removing it worked for me.
Also trying cleaning and building your gradle and afterwards restart your intelliJ. 
Sometimes a restart might resolve some file issues.

Since we are using JavaFx to create some GUI applications. We may need to save some work or clean up some things before the user chooses to exit the application. 

I would prefer to use Platform.exit(), as we can use a 'hook' method to do some cleaning before actually exiting the application like so. The 'hook' to the platform.exit() is the stop() like so:

```java
public class Duke extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {......}

    @Override
    public void stop() throws Exception {
        super.stop();
        //When platform.exit() is called, stop() will be called
        System.out.println("Application is closed");
    }
}


```

My first question seeing the topic title, what is the purpose of a constructor ? -&gt; which is mainly to initialise instance variables of a class.

Thus, failing to initialise could lead to an exception (though I believe as good practice, it would be odd to have initialisation that would have exceptions been thrown, meaning our logic perhaps may need some reworking). But I believe  the exception in the constructor should be thrown as it should rather be handled in the class that instantiantes that objects that gives rise to such exceptions rather than the constructor catching the exception. 

But, honestly it really depends on the archiecture of programe your building i guess ? Hope this helps.

Hi @Justinhoejj, 

I am using a mac and running both on terminal and clicking, I don't seem to have any issues. If you are able to run on terminal, it would mean the jar file is running as expected. Perhaps, instead of just double clicking, you could try `right click the jar file and open ?` 

Sometimes mac security would block unauthorised apps from working well as intended by double clicking so to work around it you could try right click and open the jar file and allow access in their Security & privacy settings.

Initially I did: 
`URL url = new File("src/main/resources/MainWindow.fxml").toURI().toURL();`
`Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(url);`

to get around the problem. But I realised that doing it this way would cause problems in my jar file.

Was wondering if anyone knew what the problem is.

Ok for some reason when I copy and paste the ACTUAL output into the EXPECTED within Intellij it does not tell me that there are no differences found. But if I edit the EXPECTED file externally using another editor, it now correctly tells me that there are no differences found. Not sure why though.

I believe pushing to master is fine for small projects with only 1 contributor, which is what the individual project currently is.

My `actual.txt` also does not show the user inputs. In the lecture video, it might be that the program prints out the user's command again which is why it shows up in `actual.txt`.

After packaging, I discovered that when I deleted my `bin/` folder and ran `runtest.sh` again, it would fail as the `.class` files were now in the `bin/duke` folder.

I fixed this by changing the line

I think I had this problem, and it was caused by the update to packages. Can you check your `bin/` folder? Mine seemed to have two copies of all the files, one set in `bin/` (the older version) and another set in `bin/duke` (the newer version). `runtest.sh` was using the older set in `bin/`.

Intellij? It's displayed as a one-liner but it doesn't change the underlying file. If you click on the highlighted braces it should open back up.

Anyway, even if it is actually changed, this module doesn't seem to penalise things like this. Just committing and re-tagging should be fine. (probably don't even need to retag)

From my understanding of commits, I don't really see a problem in committing incomplete/messy code to a branch? I'd just make a separate commit to finish it up or refactor it the next day and then merge to master.

If you have written so much code, to the point where you'd feel annoyed if your computer crashed and you lost that progress, doesn't that make the code "a version worth remembering" after all?

For context, this question arose when discussing #91 

Prof said:
> One benefit [of non-fast forward] is it is easy to see the start and end of the branch visually. Plus, the merge commit shows the total effect of the branch.

I think there are still pros to fast-forward merging, and it might depend on preference / team conventions? Some people might think that merge commits clutter up the history unnecessarily. If your branch only has 1 commit with a small bug fix, fast-forward merging might be cleaner since you'd only have 1 commit in `master`. An extra merge commit would be somewhat redundant here.

Full instructions for configuring checkstyle are [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html#configuring-checkstyle-rules)

> Checkstyle expects configuration files for checkstyle (e.g., files that specify which style rules to follow) to be in **`./config/checkstyle/`** by convention.
> The set of code style rules are put in the **`config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`**. To enable exceptions to code styles, you can add in the comment `//CODESTYLE.OFF: RuleName` at the start of the section and `//CODESTYLE.ON: RuleName` at the end of the section. Alternatively, you can specify which rules to suppress in a config file `config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml`

Rename your file to `checkstyle.xml` and copy the content over from [AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle).

`suppressions.xml` is a file you have to create yourself, in the same directory.

> however, after I generated a jar file and double-clicked duke.jar to run the program, a problem occurs.

Have you tried running the jar file from command line? i.e. `java -jar duke.jar`. Do you still face this problem?

> That is, it neither clears the user input bar nor print the corresponding output when I type "done 1"/"delete 2" command and click send button. (but it executes the operation, i.e. it marks an item or delete an item at the backfront)
For other commands such as "todo return book" and "list", it does work well.

Usually when I face a case of "input not getting cleared and message not getting sent", it's because some exception occurred that prevented the program from proceeding. This exception would be printed in the terminal. This seems likely in your case as well, given that it is specific to the `done` and `delete` commands but not the other commands.

Hi, I suggest checking this post [stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17300318/error-classnotfoundexception-in-intellij-idea), if it's not possible, for me personally I just use File > New > Project from Version Control (and connect it to your GitHub) and let Intellij configure the paths.

The error message indicates the java is not configured properly in your zsh. You can check this [first](https://superuser.com/questions/1636321/how-to-solve-unable-to-locate-a-java-runtime-that-supports-error) and another way is to test by opening Intellij Terminal and just type java -version or javac -version.

What FergusMok wrote was actually really nice! but besides the modularity, I think one other disadvantage that you might face with a very huge chunk of the switch statement is the burden on your IDE (IntelliJ in this case I believe), if your file becomes very huge to the point exceeding ~2k lines, when your ide tries to do syntax analysis and indexing of the file, it will take very long.

I think there are some ways, but I'm not really sure about this
1. You can supply your void functions with different inputs and check `assertDoesNotThrow`, meaning it works fine 
2. You can check invalid input and try whether any exception is thrown 
3. You can try to check whether some property changes due to the mutation by void function (or any indicator) 
4. Or check the output in `System.out`

That's my 2 cents

I think you should make the `test` folder as the Gradle test root folder.

I don't think these lines of code create the dir and the file if they don't exist before. Maybe you can use a Java `File` Object and then use the method `mkdirs` and `createNewFile` to create the file and directory first

I'm pretty sure it is not a good practice to change commit messages, especially after it has been pushed to remote + there are multiple commits on top of the commit you want to edit since you are effectively rewriting history. However, it can be done, and especially easy with a GUI; check out this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message).

Let's use the time-traveling analogy:

1. The tip of the branch is the present.
2. Checking out previous commits is like traveling back in time in a time machine.
3. The `.gitignore` file is like a list of stuff you bring along with the time machine that is not affected by the time travel, everything else that is not in the `.gitignore` list will be "reversed" in time. (Please note that the `.gitignore` file is affected by time travel too!)
4. At some point in your time traveling, you will meet two copies (versions) of the same stuff: `file_a` you brought with you in your time travel and `file_a` of the past.
5. If these 2 copies have not been changed between the present and the past, the situation you mentioned will not happen. 
6. However, if between the present and past there were some changes made to `file_a`, git will tell you that "I found 2 versions of the same file", so it will appear as unstaged changes.

This took me a while to understand, and even longer to explain LOL. Hope this helps.

> why doesn't git use the .gitignore at Point A and show the temp file at Point A

Git does use the `.gitignore` at Point A. Because the temp file is still being tracked at Point A, git notices the difference and sees it as a change. Conversely, if you check out any commit made after Point B, git does not care.

> given that we are committing the .gitignore file everytime we make a revision?

That is not the case, the `.gitignore` file is committed like any other file in git unless specified.

It might also be IntelliJ not changing your project configuration. See the top right of IntelliJ (the dropdown beside the green hammer), it might be using the build from a different branch or a previous version of your code.

I'm following the [suggested .yml file](https://github.com/se-edu/duke/blob/full-template/.github/workflows/gradle.yml) for a sample GitHub Actions workflow, and I have a few questions about the `steps` of the job:

- Why do we need 2 "Set up repository" steps at the start? And why does the second `checkout` action insists on `ref: master`, what happens if I'm pushing from a non-master branch?
- Third step, why is it called "Merge to master"? I thought the `git checkout` command here means switching to the commit that triggered the workflow...
- I know we can remove the last 3 segments for I/O redirection tests, but I would like to ask why do we need `always()` for the last two steps? I'm referring to the part `if: always() && runner.os == 'macOS'`
- Finally, many actions seem to use an older version, like `actions/checkout@master`. I see the GitHub tutorials use `actions/checkout@v2`, is there a reason for this?

Through the iP I can understand how to branch and merge with git, but how does this work for a real team project? I can think of a scenario like this:

Suppose 2 people A and B each work on a separate feature. They create their own branch, `branch-A` and `branch-B`, branching out from the same commit on `master`. Person A, who has finished working on the feature, creates a PR which is approved and merged into `master`. Meanwhile person B is still working in `branch-B`.

- Should B pull from remote to check for updates in `master`? Or just concentrate and finish their work?
- If B should pull, what if B only wants to pick _some_ changes from the updated `master`, not everything?

Initially, class `Duke` only contains the `main` method. Now I want to have some instance attributes in `Duke`, so I can instantiate it inside `main()` like this:

```java
public class Duke {
  private String someAttribute;

  private Duke(String s) {
    someAttribute = s;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // print logo
    Duke d = new Duke("Hello");
    // do other things...
  }
}
```
Is this considered bad practice? I think it might be OK as long as I set the attributes and constructor as `private`, but I've read elsewhere that the class containing `main` -- in this case, class `Duke` -- should only serve as the entry point of the programme and have no other methods or attributes.

I encountered the read-only file issue before (though not because of Gradle), and I followed this [S/O answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44265670/how-to-change-read-only-status-of-files-in-intellij).

I think you can try merging the branch `add-gradle-support` to add the Gradle files instead of adding them by yourself (that's how I did it following the [SE-EDU tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) given on the cs2103 web page).

My inexperienced opinion is that work-in-progress commits are okay, especially when you're working on a branch. There is a [`squash`](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash/) command in Git that combines multiple commits into one, which should be useful when you want to tidy up the commit log after finishing your work.

@weichang18 I'm having the same error as well, and my DialogBox is exactly the same from the tutorial. Throws a `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException` whenever I hit enter in the text input or click Send, but based on the stack trace I think the actual cause is due to a `NullPointerException` somewhere. Pls post the solution if you find one 🙏

Update: Turns out the problem is in my Duke class. The app goes from Launcher -&gt; Main -&gt; MainWindow -&gt; Duke, but my Duke was not properly initialised (due to copying my original code) so it causes a null pointer exception.

@SkyBlaise99 To my understanding when GitHub Actions run `./gradlew check`, that command already runs the JUnit tests. That's because the Gradle `check` task depends on the `test` task, which are your unit tests executed with JUnit.

uh I think it runs JUnit tests only, that's why they put 3 segments at the end for the I/O redirection tests. But since our iP is moving to a GUI now, those tests are no longer relevant and can be removed from the script.

Would it be ok to align the descriptions of the parameters to the same indentation? I find it neater that way:
```java

Another solution would be to build a jar and just run through that instead. You can do testing in intelliJ itself otherwise using the start button, just make sure to add any generated files in your project directory to your .gitignore :)

try to google how the git push command works. Level-7 is not the remote you're pushing to, it's the tag name. git push takes in the remote as the first parameter, so in this case it was trying to push to the remote 'Level-7', which doesn't exist

In general do not use `==` for non primitive types, since java treats instances of classes as different objects for that. Where possible, opt for the `equals()` method.

It will depend on where everyone puts their files and how they structure their packages, but generally change the value for `fx:controller` to your own package path to `MainWindow` and it should work fine.

Hi Guys, our team is in a Team meeting facing an issue for choosing a direction in whether Evolve or Morph.

After we go through the grading script, I still have 2 questions, 
https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-grading.html

1. If I add more features without bugs in Morph, then will I get more marks, compared to normal features without bugs in Evolve？

2. Will we can get more marks in a good design GUI, "smarter CLI"?

3. If we just solve all the bugs in AB3, fit the main features to the topic like (CLI, User-friendly GUI) in "Context management - Evolve",  without adding any extra features, what kind of result or mark we will get?

Thanks a lot

Hi all, I have a few questions not related to cs2103t this module, but related to git/Github please help me clarify:

I have noticed that when push commits to GitHub, it will have a record to the contribution record in the green graph.
But these days' commits have not been displayed in the green contribution graph.

May I check what is the reason? Is it because the forked project won't be displayed?

My issues were solved by these steps:
1. Go GitHub setting > Developer Setting > Personal access token > Generate a new Token 
2. (Optional) if you push previously with an error, you can go to SourceTree > Perferecnes > Advanced > Delete hostname history
3. Push again, enter git username and personal access token generated in step 1

On searching the internet, I found a solution to use `Font` like:
```Java
        Font defaultFont = new Font("Arial", 15);
        Label helloWorld = new Label("Hello World!");
        helloWorld.setFont(defaultFont);
        Scene scene = new Scene(helloWorld);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
```
and this works fine.
output:

I have a workaround, but is there any possible way to fix this and avoid using `Font`, which works just fine?

Seems quite unlikely that your com will die so badly that your commits/changes would not be saved (unless maybe you lose your com or it gets stolen). But if you're worried maybe create a branch (e.g. "work-in-progress") for you to dump the changes you've made so far?

See https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/pull/106 for the changes made to AB3 to fix the font problem. We probably should do something similar for iP.

You are using the ARM version of java i think. If you previously installed java using brew then you are definitely using ARM java.

@rohit0718 You have to run java under rosetta 2. Java ARM works fine but dependencies might not be updated yet. I faced this issue when i was running AB3 for the first time. Deleted ARM java and installed Java x86 one and it worked.

Hi Prof @damithc, may I know what exactly is the problem here? I have tested jar files for my friends for iP, one of them using windows and another MacOS catalina (intel system) and I have no problem running them under rosetta.

Edit: I realised that both of them are using custom CSS files to specify fonts that are available in all systems. For those who are facing this problem, you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwV_L3lKYYw) to uninstall java first before installing the version mentioned by prof @damithc  above. I tested a jar file that does not set the font, it seems to work.

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: My welcome message is truncated**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/252" expanded>

For some reason, only my welcome message is truncated. Additionally, only the last line is truncated. If it has 2 lines, the 2nd line will become an ellipsis. If it has 8 lines, the 8th line will be truncated to become an ellipsis. However, if it only has 1 line, it works fine so technically, as a hacky solution (and potentially a last resort), I could just make my greeting 1 line. 

I've found that removing `wrapText="true"` fixes this, but causes every other dialog box to be  truncated (because as a result of removing `wrapText="true` it doesn't wrap).

This is how it looks like now (Ignore the messed up logo, its due to a recent change in font):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/133774018-e3e95fab-0d67-4b29-9486-d5dda41358e7.png)

Another odd thing is how this problem came about. Originally, my program worked fine (on Windows OS), and nothing was truncated. However, when I sent my friend (MacOS) for testing, all my dialog boxes were truncated. So I went to fix it by editing the `.fxml` files. As a result, this problem arose. However, if I remove my changes, the problem does not seem to go away.

Below are my `fxml` files for reference:

`DialogBox.fxml`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77266823/133774839-0abced9b-fbb9-4e07-ad76-517f89698bb3.png)

Lastly, I found this issue on a CS2103 forum dated 2 years ago that mentions changing from `Label` to `Text` might fix this, but I tried and I got some other issue like unsupported operand or something. Plus doing so might result me in having to change other settings such as padding, etc, so I rather not. If it can't be solved, I think I will just change my greeting to 1 line, but I was just wondering why it's so weird.

Previously my UI class involved methods that printed the logo, single and double divider lines,  and obtaining user input using `Scanner`. Since the addition of the GUI, we no longer need UI elements like divider lines, and no longer need to obtain user input using `Scanner`. Thus I deleted the UI class altogether. But do I technically now fall short of the minimal requirements for week 3's `A-MoreOOP`? It mentioned that one of the minimal requirements was to have a UI class, or does it just mean at that point of time (when u check the tag), the commit should have the UI class.

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: Conventions about importing Sub-packages**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/73" expanded>

I'm trying to separate the classes further into sub-packages, but some classes from one sub-package uses instances of classes (sometimes many) from another sub-package.

1) Am I supposed to import them from 1 sub-package to another? Feels kind of weird.

2) Usually the convention is to not use * in imports. For example, we shouldn't use `java.util.*`, but how about importing other sub-packages? For example can I use `import duke.task.*;` , especially when I want to use all of the classes in that sub-package.

3) How should I order these imports? For example should the imports from other sub-packages within the same package come before the other imports like from `java.util`? And should they be separated by a blank line? I could not find these in the CS2103T website conventions.

It seems that the path to the tests need to be exactly `/src/test/java/test.java`.

Should a static method even be overridden? Static means the method can be called without an instance, and with no object instance theres no dynamic binding or calling of overridden methods taking place

May I please ask what is relationship between software under test (SUT), Unit testing, Regression Testing, Test Automation, Test Driver, Stub (There are the contents under testing topic)?

This is my understanding below:

The developer 
1. need to perform testing (Developer Testing) for the software (SUT). 
2. can use JUnit to make testing automation. (When using the Junit framework, does it mean that dont need to implement the test driver class?)
3. need to implement unit testing for each function, and need to implement Stub for the tested function to isolate dependencies if the logic in the function depends on other functions.
4. need to run all the test cases (Regression Testing) again after bug fixed.

And I dont quite understand the question 29: "A stub is an alternative implementation of an SUT; by having two alternative implementations, we reduce the risk of bugs."

I think the first part of the sentence "A stub is an alternative implementation of an SUT" is correct right? Then what is the meaning of "by having two alternative implementations"?

I share some my own opinion:
1. I think the developer should keep pulling the latest version of the code from mater.
2. Need one developer to manage the master, means he is the leader to press the "Agree to merge" button. Before merging the PR, all the developers should sit together to do a code review for the PR to make sure the PR is bug free and all of them agree with the change of PR.
3. Then I don't think your second point will happen if following the 2 steps above.

In terms of grading, there is no difference between the two options.

Dear prof @damithc 

I really appreciate your detail explanation.

Actually I only know that the effort is evaluated by peers who tested your product and tutors, I didn't see more information about it.
Regarding the sentence "If the implementation effort required to create AB3 from scratch is 10", may I please ask if there is any specific standard or baseline for "created AB3" (means how many functions do we need to complete to get 10)?
Some one think that completing 10 functions will get 10, but some others think that completing 1 function will get 10, although both projects are bug free.

I think should not remove the text-ui-test path in the yml because it will run the all test cases in it during the CI. If all these files are ignored, then it just run nothing and pass all the test cases.

I think the reason is the GUI cannot be executed during the CI, you should exclude your GUI Main.class and Launcher.class and other GUI related files in runtest.bat or runtest.sh to make sure your text-ui-test can run properly before push to CI.

Thank you for all your help fellow peers and profs! I figured out my mistake. I was calling an arraylist before initializing it.
I understood my mistake by eyeballing my code, so my question still stands. However, I will close this issue.

Prof @damithc clicking at those nodes did not reveal more information. They just collapsed the menu, basically acted as arrows.
@marcuspeh as mentioned in the question, I already ran `stack trace` it was not of any help.

I encountered an issue where my `ACTUAL.TXT` and `EXPECTED.TXT` differ by a few trailing spaces (in the logo area).

Hence, I manually add the missing trailing spaces to `EXPECTED .TXT` in **Intellij**. The newly added trailing spaces are there after I saved the file. However, they always disappear after I run `runtest.bat`.

I tried copy over the content from `ACTUAL.TXT` to `EXPECTED.TXT` using `Ctrl + a`, `Ctrl + c` and `Ctrl + v`, but those spaces were somehow not copied over, i.e. the difference between the files remains the same.

To solve this, I changed `line 18` of `runtest.bat` from
`java -classpath ..\bin Blue &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT`
to 
`java -classpath ..\bin Blue &gt; input.txt > EXPECTED.TXT`
so that the outputs were printed to `EXPECTED.TXT` directly.

This will result in the following error in console:
`FC: cannot open ACTUAL.TXT - No such file or folder`
but it will disappear in the next run after we change `line 18` of `runtest.bat` back to its original form.

Note that I couldn't replicate the issue after getting the correct content into my `EXPECTED.TXT`. 
I am not sure how the issue happened, but I hope this tip can help those who face a similar situation.

The class symbol is correct, and it has the correct file extension in Explorer. 

However, it cannot resolve the class when referenced in `MainWindow.fxml`, as indicated by the red text.

This suggests that the red text

might be due to failing to resolve them.

Note that when I type `blue.` the autocomplete options included `MainWindow`, which after selected, shows in red.
On the other hand, a `MainWind` class that I created again to test, shows in the autocomplete options too. And when selected, it shows normally in `MainWindow.fxml`, but the file title `MainWind` is shown red in the side bar.

This seems like a syncing issue between files. So, I tried _Invalidate caches_ again, but the problem remains (after finish indexing).

Hi @Jh123x thanks for the reply. I have marked the ```java``` folder under ```[project root]/src/test/java``` as the test source rather than the ```test``` folder, as per the steps of the guide provided to our batch. 

I understand that you are cloning my repo and trying it out on your local env. Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it! I have yet to push anything regarding Junit testing to my master branch. But to summarize the steps I took, from my latest github commit, I basically followed the steps of the guide [https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html), right until step 7.2.

According to the Intellij Hints, I am adding Junit 5.7.0.

@Jh123x replacing the section of ip.iml that you highlighted did not work for me. However, you mentioned that you were developing on windows 10 natively while I was using WSL. I cloned the repo onto the native windows env and worked on that repo instead, which solved the issue for me.

> For the last part, I realize that the warning "missing return statement" is actually not due to the missing of return statement in catch block, but rather, it's that in the try block, I have an isolate if block which does nothing but throws an exception. That's the real cause of the error message. But I still don't know what to do in this case. My logic for that particular scenario is that when the if condition is met then the method should just throw an exception; it just doesn't make any sense to return anything afterwards... So what should I do?

As per this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33536321), all logical paths must result in a valid exit of the method, i.e. for all possible cases, either something is returned or an exception is thrown as per the method signature. 

So it might not be the case that Intellij expects you to return something in your if-block, but rather, that for a particular path of logic in your method, nothing is returned or thrown. 

**Maybe** Intellij's linter isn't smart enough to definitively pinpoint where the leakage is, which is why it is wrongly flagging it in your if-block. (Don't quote me on this though)

Edit: Is the problem that you are facing a compilation error, or a hint by Intellij's linter? If it is the former, then it is definitively the case that for some case(s), nothing is returned or thrown.

In this version I removed the final 'else' part so that if both if conditions aren't met then the method is **guaranteed to return something**, which should be ok...?

There are a few scenarios where your method does not return anything. 

Suppose the first if-statement in your try-block throws the InvalidInputException, then the subsequent lines of code in the try-block will not be executed. Instead, your method will catch the InvalidInputException in your catch-block and execute the sout statement. Once that is done, your method no longer has anything else to execute, but has to exit without returning anything, which is not a valid behaviour since it is expecting a String to be returned.

Hopefully this makes things clearer!

This method LGTM in terms of covering all logical paths, but if it is necessary for you catch the exception within the method itself, it could be good to draw out a tree of the possible cases you expect, and use that as a reference when crafting your method. 

Otherwise, it could be good to think about whether it is really necessary for you to catch the exception there and then. 
(I personally prefer deferring the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so, since the method can always bubble the problem upwards until a point where someone else has to catch it eventually. However, if it is not necessary for the method to catch and resolve it but is caught and resolved by the method anyways, it might lead to some other problems down the line, where we need the exception as part of the logic flow of another method, but we are unable to "uncatch" the exception that was already caught, if that makes sense to you)

> Somehow I still feel like we should keep the "influence scope" of an exception as small as possible so that we won't need to worry about it elsewhere? Why does it make sense to "defer the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so"?

An example I can think of is this:
Imagine if the person who wrote Java's ```ArrayList::get``` method handled the ```IndexOutOfBoundsException``` within the method itself, rather than throwing it. (Maybe instead of throwing the exception, the method prints "The index that was specified is out of bounds", and then returns null)

We, the users of ```ArrayList::get```, would probably prefer it more if the person did not design the method in such a way. In most cases, we would probably prefer the method to throw the exception, so that we can decide on the most meaningful way to deal with it instead.

Of course, this is just my opinion on this, and I'm sure there are many counter-examples that can justify why we should keep the "influence scope" of exceptions as small as possible. Ultimately, the complex nature of code design makes it a nuanced subject, so I think the most important thing is that the way you design your code should make logical sense to you; if writing your code in a certain way doesn't feel right to you, then it probably isn't. (With that being said, we will still have to adhere to the design conventions stipulated by the module, or any other rules established in any other projects. But, apart from those set of rules, I believe we are free to exercise our own judgement call)

so i think i have solved the issue. i think it really could be because of the accidental deletion of my remote coding standard branch. my i solved it by first resetting to one of my early coding standard commits and then recommitting and reversing that commit (very confusing stuff)... but bottom line is, dont delete your remote branches (at least in the context of this mod)

It could be due to trailing spaces being removed by IntelliJ automatically. (If you select the text above you'll see the second line has spaces after the last underscore but the first doesn't.)

I originally put the spaces in for _`expected.txt`_ and only realised later that IntelliJ was trimming all trailing white spaces every time I saved the file. Unfortunately `diff` (in Mac at least) does not support ignoring trailing white spaces so I went to IntelliJ and disabled their function.

I'm just guessing here, how `System` actually works is beyond me, so please take this with a grain of salt:

`System.in` is a stream, and for every `Scanner` object you create it will take in `System.in` and try to read the next few bytes of the user input. Problem is, Java streams are meant to be consumed and cannot be reused. If you use up a position on a stream, you can't reread it, and the only way forward is to take up the next step in the stream.

Maybe if multiple Scanners try to read the same `System.in`, only the first one manages to move the position to the next point in the stream, and the rest are in an unreadable position?

If you are the type to do a lot of commits to 'checkpoint', I recommend checking out `git rebase -i` to quickly squash, reorder and amend commit messages to clean up the mess. If you don't specify any other arguments to `git rebase -i`, it will default to letting you work on all the commits on your current branch right up to the last push.

Btw, its not a good practice to force push (in case someone is checking out your branch), so please avoid amending any commit that you've already pushed.

Hey I had this question too and I was looking around and found [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46060236/4179939) that explains the difference between the two.

The tldr of it is that `Platform.exit()` calls for JFX to close up shop and exit gracefully, running clean up code if provided. Since your original java file likely only has a single line calling for `Application.launch()` there's nothing left for the Java virtual machine to do and it exits.

On the other hand `System.exit()` demands the Java virtual machine to terminate and doesn't allow for any further execution of JFX or any other code.

Looks to me the better practice would be to run `Platform.exit()` but in our case if no clean up code is required it won't cause too much harm to do the other one.

Sorry, this wouldn't really help your current situation, but just FYI: package names are supposed to be all in lowercase, so it should be the package `duke` not `Duke`. (So the package name is `duke.Duke`, not `Duke.Duke`). Remember to change the folder name too!

Btw your Github action currently calls for the task to be run on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms, and you have to wait for all the tasks to be repeated thrice. If you are just running `gradlew check` for checkstyle and you aren't testing anything that could be platform dependent, you can do just run the action on just linux and save your time. 

Something like this:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Replacing these lines:
```
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        platform: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]

Had a similar experience, my JAR was failing on account of missing dependencies on every Linux and windows, but perfectly fine on macOS machines. Fixed it by explicitly calling for all platform releases of JavaFX to be included as per the solution (changed `build.gradle` like [this](73194c0e691e1507342a64dcaf9b44ae4e1fedab)).

Hi there, have you tried having your GUI output the file path used in a dialog box? Then when you run the jar with a double click it is possible you can see location and probably troubleshoot from there.

I am getting the same error as well but my dialog box is exactly the same as the one from tutorial. The error seems to appear whenever my duke function calls for a function of another class.

I think the aim of `iP` is to procedurally go from testing via CLI to testing via GUI. I fully test on GUI now as the functionality is exactly the same, just that it has a fancy UI to display the results. At least, it motivates us to intuitively create our GUI such that it fully mimics the experience of using the CLI version of the chatbot. Once we have the GUI, there doesn't seem to be a need to go back to the CLI anymore because the UX and user flow are the exact same.

Am I right in saying that this is the objective of the `Duke iP`? @damithc

## Issue
I merged the `add-gradle-support` branch and following the steps as described here under scenario 2. Tried running some of the tasks on the Intellij interface and most of the tasks worked (except runShadow for some reason, and the ones that require checkstyle.xml to run)

> These tasks work

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131248683-496af658-e965-4df0-a6d5-178689974812.png)

I then tried running `gradlew clean` from the command line, and encountered this exception:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873431/131248849-a2eecf81-0714-42e8-bca7-4962aa98878a.png)

And any follow up attempts to run `gradlew clean` again hits me with this:

Weirdly enough, running clean from the Intellij GUI works, so I have no idea what's going on.

Here is gradle version:

### following the [tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#using-gradle-to-do-some-common-project-activities) scenario 2.

1. Merge `add-gradle-support` into main
2. Close the project
3. Delete .idea folder in project root
4. Let project rebuild after restarting
5. File > Invalidate Caches / Restart > INVALIDATE CACHE AND RESTART
6. Update build.gradle's application mainClassName 
```java
application {
    mainClassName = "duke.Duke"
}
```
7. Build project
8. Use windows command prompt and navigate to project root
9. run command `gradlew clean`

Regarding the java style guide as laid out here: https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.htm

It is stated that
```
 The switch statement should have the following form: Note there is no indentation for case clauses.
 Configure your IDE to follow this style instead.
```

```java
switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;
case XYZ:
    statements;
    break;
default:
    statements;
    break;
}
```

This is not the default indentation behavior of the Intellij IDE, and upon checking the settings, I couldn't find a way to configure the indentation rules such that it will follow this style. 

Does anyone know of a way to configure the settings such that the above style is followed?

Hi, just to clarify, upon implementing level 4 which is support for the 3 different task types, can we drop support for adding a generic task (i.e. tasks added without being preceded by any keywords such as "todo", "deadline", and "event"), or should we continue to allow users to add such generic tasks? 

```
read book
    ____________________________________________________________

     added: read book
    ____________________________________________________________
```


If we continue to support adding of generic tasks, this will conflict with the example as seen in the error handling, 
```
blah
    ____________________________________________________________

     ☹ OOPS!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-(
    ____________________________________________________________
```
Here "blah" would have been interpreted as just another generic task if we continued to support adding of generic tasks.

Good spot! Turns out it runs on the ide because the ide is configured to use the 11.0.9 jdk, but from the command line uses the default jdk on the system which is the 16.0.2 version. Gradle 6.2 does not support the newer jdks, so it doesn't build correctly.

I have gotten a few comments pointing out that my method below is not named as a verb:

```java
public static String outOfBoundsString(int index) {
    return String.format("Out of bounds: %d", index);
}
```
One suggestion I've been given is to name it `printOutOfBoundsString`, however I feel that this might give the impression that the method might look something like this:

```java
public static void printOutOfBoundsString(int index) {
    System.out.println(
            String.format("Out of bounds: %d", index));
}
```
Furthermore, I think the original name makes more sense when I do something like `System.out.print(outOfBoundsString(index))` as opposed to `System.out.print(printOutOfBoundsString(index))`.

Is there a better way of naming this method / any method that returns a string but doesn't print it?

When listing a large number of tasks, most of them get cut off due to the height constraint of the dialog box. Is there any way to make it scale based on the length of text? 

I've tried setting the Max Height of the dialog box to 'Use Computed Size' but that didn't do it, as the height was still constrained by the main window itself.

If I'm understanding the website instructions correctly, I think importantly is that the commit that signifies the completion of each level should be tagged, e.g. Level-1, Level-2 etc. I believe these can be done even after commits have been pushed. As for changing the commit message of pushed commits, I think this is more complicated and I have no idea how it might be done.

I had the same problem with the substring, what I did was to declare a constant for my operation name and then do `str.substring(operationString.length() + 1)`. My rationale is that this magic number depends on the name of the operation.

I think it is a magic literal though. If someone else looks at it, can they tell why `substring(4)` and not 5 or some other number? I think if they can then it's fine to use it but in this case, someone who doesn't have any context might not understand the number which makes it 'magic'.

            previousStates.push(newTaskList);

If you have added the correct dependencies to your build.gradle file and javafx is still not being recognised, click the 'Reload All Gradle Projects' button. It should work after that.

What I did was I printed out the bye message, and then used Java's Timer class to set a delay on the Platform.exit() command. That way you can have the bye message be visible to the user for as long you wish before closing the application.

Hi, I was wondering if there was any guidelines or checklist for stuff we should consider asserting. For example, should we assert trivial stuff like 

```java
    public void add(Task toAdd) {
        assert toAdd != null;

        this.tasks.add(toAdd);
    }
```
or like `assert taskList != null` ? They seem to be very minor. Additionally, google says that it is a bad practice to assert public methods. Are we supposed to follow that? [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5404754/why-cant-we-use-assertion-for-public-methods#:~:text=%22An%20assert%20is%20inappropriate%20in,exception%20of%20the%20specified%20type.)

Hi guys, after using shadowJar to build the fat jar file, while running the duke.jar file in my build/libs folder, it opens up the CLI and not the GUI. The GUI is supposed to open up, isn't it? Do you guys know what is the reason? My duke.jar file is 11MB so I believe it is a fat jar file.

Thanks @yucheng11122017 for sharing your experience on assertions and how you have used it in your iP, it definitely helps in giving me some insightful ideas! 

Thanks @chunweii for sharing your thoughts as well and about using assertion to check invariants, it seems very useful in that scenario. The link you sent is very informative and it explains clearly why we should not use it to check for arguments in public methods, and also some useful guidelines and places we can consider putting assertions in. Recommend others to check it out if you guys need some concrete guidelines to follow like me 😄

Just to confirm, we are allowed to have multiple tags tagged to a single commit right? 

For example can we have both `Level-3` and `A-Classes` tagged to commit `aabbcc1`? Or must each commit only have 1 tag?

I think at this point its just semi-automated testing in the sense that you can run one command and it will tell you whether the outputs match or not instead of you manually having to type out all those lines of commands individually and manually checking whether the outputs are correct. For reference, if everything works out and the outputs match the following should be printed onto your screen:

The automated testing that you are referring to requires some testing frameworks like JUnit which is part of [week 3](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/project.html) requirements under `A-JUnit`.

To add on, if you are sure that your `ACTUAL.txt` and `EXPECTED.txt` only differs because of trailing spaces or due to some UNIX vs Windows formatting issue, one way to "copy EXACTLY" is by using the command `cp ACTUAL.txt EXPECTED.txt`. I faced similar issues and this worked for me.

One possible way to do it is by overriding the `toString()` method of `Event`, `ToDo` and `Deadline` to return the formatted outputs and then looping through and printing out each of the task in your `List&gt;Task>`.

For asserting console outputs in JUnit tests, I have been following [this](http://www.mastertheboss.com/various-stuff/testing-java/how-to-verify-the-console-output-in-junit-tests/) tutorial and it has worked well for me. You can take a look and see if it works for you too!

I don't think that there is really any hard rule that says when you should commit but generally the rule of thumb is that you should commit per logical change and commits should be rather atomic. One reason why you should keep your commits rather short is because it is easier to explain what you did in your commit messages which makes it clear for people to know exactly what each commit is for. If you only commit at the end of the day, chances are you have made changes to multiple things in your project and people will have to read through the changes to actually figure out what has changed instead of just reading the commit message header. I think that [this article](https://medium.com/@asifnahian/git-how-often-should-you-commit-c133e5473d76) summarizes this issue quite well!

@ErnestCuong @marcuspeh Thanks for the reply guys.

I've already tried deleting the tag locally and re-tagging it, and then trying to push it to the remote again, only to get back the same error.

I think I may have misnamed one of my branches yesterday (I called it Level-8 instead of branch-Level-8). I changed it on the remote but I did not change it locally. 

I have now renamed my wrongly-named branch on my local repo as well, and I am able to successfully push my tags to the remote repo. Cheers! Appreciate the quick reply.

I was wondering what are the possible efficient way to produce the output for the list command. As of right now, I am utilizing the StringBuilder and go through the list one by one. I imagine there is a more efficient way to do it?

Hi guys, I'm currently trying to do the GUI (level 10) by making the Duke class extends Application and implement the start method of javafx. However, when I try to launch Duke, it shows this error instead:

`Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Duke.Main.Duke.&gt;init>()`

I've only added JavaFX on the Duke class (the class that runs the entire chat bot, main one) and nothing else. Is there any mistake I might have encountered in trying to incorporate JavaFX into Duke? 

To be more specific, I'm using Window on my laptop, and when I run JavaFX on a separate project, this problem does not show up.

Much appreciate any help!

Hi guys, I'm currently trying to merge my IP with the add-gradle branch, but when I try to reload gradle project, there is this error coming up on gradle sync issues:

`Could not install Gradle distribution from 'https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.2-bin.zip'.`

I've tried to download the file manually, but I couldn't understand how to actually import the zip file or whichever file is required.

Hi guys, I would like to ask a question on saving task list modification in Duke, specifically on efficiency and runtime.

Is runtime important? In trying to save changes in the list of task, I decided to rewrite the file all over again, as in, iterate through the task List and manually rewrite the file from begin to end.

Is this an acceptable approach to Level-7?
Or do I have to trace which task has changed, then search through .txt file for the task that matches and modify only that specific line? Would that be possible?

Ah okay thanks, so it is acceptable to rewrite the entire file only after the exit command, and I don't need to update the file after each command-reply cycle?

The jar file I created works well in its created folder. However, after I copied and pasted it onto my Desktop folder, it throws some exceptions as shown below.

My understanding of the diff btw exception and assertion is that exception is triggered by a user mistake but the assertion by a programmer mistake? So for some potentially programmer-induced mistake, if you have used exception, can consider use assertion instead? 

> * The raising of an exception indicates an unusual condition created by the user (e.g. user inputs an unacceptable input) or the environment (e.g., a file needed for the program is missing).
> * An assertion failure indicates the programmer made a mistake in the code (e.g., a null value is returned from a method that is not supposed to return null under any circumstances).

Encountered the error again when I was testing my jar file on my friend's laptop (macbook, I am using windows).

For some reasons my Intellij stuck at Step 2.1 which is to create module from existing sources. So, If your Intellij happens to stuck at Step 2.1 of this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html) as well, you can create a new module instead of creating from existing sources. Just delete the `src` within test folder after you have created the module and follow from Step 3 onwards.

Another note is that if the dummy test does not compile, go to Project Structure -&gt; Modules -&gt; Dependency and set junit to compile as shown here.

Hi thanks for this suggestion, I changed the package name from the original `seedu.duke.Duke` to `duke.Duke`to match my own package name. I was able to run `run` but not `checkstyleMain` and the error still persists.

```java

Thank you it works now. I believe my whole issue started from what @YaleChen299 mentioned which led to a bug in
adding the configuration file as well:
> A possible bug that I can think of is:
maybe the main class specified in build.gradle is different from your package name.
This happened to me and I couldn't run checkstyleMain and run.

Now that I've corrected both issues, the `checkstyleMain` works now. Thank you, everyone! 🥳

Hi friends,

I am trying to create a table using GFMD. It looks good when I view it on GitHub preview.

![question1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66736794/133621838-36b0a2a6-c73a-4e76-8489-6bb354c958b2.jpg)

But when I view it on the User Guide which we are supposed to create, the table did not appear and it looks like this and have formatting errors. 

![question2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66736794/133622059-5402b9f7-27f1-4df2-a23c-35ffb73a40ad.jpg)

Does anyone know how to create a table on the User Guide page?

Thanks!

Hello everyone, I am facing some issues with the part on TextUiTesting. 

I have prepared my input.txt file with multiple lines of inputs. However, when I run the .bat file, it only takes in the first line. 

Here's my "input.txt" file:
```text
todo borrow book
list
deadline return book /by sunday
event project meeting /at Mon 2-4pm
list
bye
```

This is my "actual.txt" file created:
```text
 ____        _        
|  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

___________________________________________
Hello! I'm Duke
What can I do for you?
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
	[T][ ] borrow book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
___________________________________________
```

Am I doing something wrong with the I/O redirection technique such that it only takes in the first line of input? Also, according to the recorded lecture video on testing, the "actual.txt" shows that input by the user but mine does not. Is that also normal?

Thanks!

you need to add these two files in the following location

{projectFolder}/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml
{projectFolder}/config/checkstyle/suppressions.xml

checkstyle.xml and suppressions.xml can be retrieved from the addressbook repo

Yes, simply delete the tag and then reassign it to the new commit. 

1. If the tag has been pushed to remote repository, run 'git push origin --delete tagname' to delete the tag in the remote. 
2. Then you can do 'git tag -d tagname' which deletes the tag on your local repo. 
3. Assign the tag to the correct commit-id using 'git tag tagname commitId' 
4. Then you can push your reassigned tags to the remote repo with 'git push --tags'

I'm assuming you're referring to the text-ui-test's bat file. 
With additional packages, you can just leave it as: `javac  -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\*.java`

I think a potential place to avoid assertions for would be for public method arguments (since assertions can be disabled, it can cause erroneous results when assertions are turned off).

Another place is to avoid assertions to perform work that the application needs for correct operation.

I followed the JavaFX tutorial here to set up JavaFX with Gradle [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html). When I run the launcher, I got this error message `Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error initializing QuantumRenderer: no suitable pipeline found`. 

So I executed the code again with `--scan` and got the following error messages this time.

There was an issue reported about the font's not displaying properly for some Mac users, although it was mostly fixed, the help screen still has an issue. Reference to issue here: #66.

The issue with the help window is that the HelpWindow.fxml file does not initialize the CSS file required and hence I think goes with the default base font. I have fixed this issue by making a few changes to the FXML and the DarkTheme.css files.

I have attached the modified files. replace the original with them and also install the attached font  and it should fix the font issues.

As pointed out there will be an issue if files are packaged since javac doesn't look for files recursively. 

To solve that issue you need to make these changes:

**For Mac OS/Linux**:
```sh
# compile the code into the bin folder, terminates if error occurred
find ../src/main/java/*/*.java  > sources.txt

if ! javac -cp ../src/main/java -Xlint:none -d ../bin @sources.txt
then
    echo "********** BUILD FAILURE **********"
    exit 1
fi
```

**For Windows**:
```bat
REM compile the code into the bin folder
dir /s /B  ../src/main/java/*/*.java > sources.txt
javac  -cp ..\src\main\java -Xlint:none -d ..\bin @sources.txt
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo ********** BUILD FAILURE **********
    exit /b 1
)
```

I hope this helps everyone :)

The original solution was actually intended for those who are running the application from IntelliJ. 

For those using the jar file. You will need to add the three included font files into the Mac's FontBook and ensure that it's added under computer (for all users). Then you can run the included jar file.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Exception handling -- When to use try & catch block and when to add exception to method signature**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96" expanded>

Hi classmates and profs, I have some questions about exception handling:

We know when there is an exception in a method, we can either: 
-throw that object so that another piece of code can catch it and deal with it, or
-use a try-catch block to deal with the exception within the method body.

In our iP there are indeed a lot of cases in which we need to handle exceptions, but I'm not sure when to use which method. Is there a general suggestion for **when to use which kind of method for exception handling**? Somehow I feel like we should use try-catch as much as possible, since in this case the exception would be handled immediately and thus we don't need to worry about having to deal with exceptions elsewhere? 

Moreover, when I try to use try-catch block within **a method that returns something** (i.e., the method return type is not void), in this case if my catch block only throws an exception without returning anything, Intellij will give me an error message saying I'm **"missing return statement"**. But sometimes it just doesn't make sense to return anything in the catch block, then what else can I do?
</panel>

<panel  header="**2 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96#issuecomment-905452477" expanded>

For the last part, I realize that the warning "missing return statement" is actually not due to the missing of return statement in catch block, but rather, it's that in the try block, I have an isolate if block which does nothing but throws an exception. That's the real cause of the error message. But I still don't know what to do in this case. My logic for that particular scenario is that when the if condition is met then the method should just throw an exception; it just doesn't make any sense to return anything afterwards... So what should I do? 
</panel>

<panel  header="**3 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/96#issuecomment-905592069" expanded>

Thanks for the answers! Below is the code I'm working with. Now I realize it's because if none of the if/else block is met then the method indeed returns nothing, which is invalid. 

```   
public String getKeyword()  {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            else return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
```

If I insist in this logic, then I have to remove the try/catch block and instead add exception to method signature like this:

```
public String getKeyword() throws InvalidInputException {
        if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
        if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
        else return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();
    }
```

However, I'm still not sure why the implementation below doesn't work. In this version I removed the final 'else' part so that if both if conditions aren't met then the method is **guaranteed to return something**, which should be ok...? (but intellij is still giving me the error of missing return statement)

``` 
public String getKeyword() {
        try {
            if (this.cmdString.length() < 6) throw new InvalidInputException();
            if (this.cmdString.substring(5).trim().length() == 0) throw new InvalidInputException();
            **return this.cmdString.substring(5).trim();**
        } catch (InvalidInputException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
```

Thanks for this detailed explanation! 
But TBH I'm still not quite sure about when to catch an exception. Somehow I still feel like we should keep the "influence scope" of an exception as small as possible so that we won't need to worry about it elsewhere? Why does it make sense to  "defer the act of catching the exception until it is absolutely necessary to do so"?

Hello,

I am planning to use a font called [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) for my iP project. On the website, under FAQ > Usage, the author said that he'd "appreciate it if you referred others to this web site rather than serving the font files from elsewhere". Would a line in the `Readme` file crediting the author of the font suffice? Since a font is not a 3rd party library, do I have to submit a third party request to use the font?

Error: Invalid or corrupt jar file iP.jar

I have tried running the program in IntelliJ terminal and it works so I think the problem occurs when creating the jar file.

Edit: Running the program through IntelliJ and not the terminal (like right clicking Duke and doing run Duke.main()) results in an error saying "could not find or load main class duke.Duke". I suspect its a problem with how the project is packaged but don't know what the issue is

Thanks Marcus! I realized that this particular issue is because I accidentally set the protocol to SSH instead of HTTPS, but then when I changed it I ran into problems which the thread helped solve! 

Another issue I ran into that im not sure if it was mentioned already, but there was an issue of permissions with the Personal Access Token, where permission was denied when pushing to the remote repo, but this can be solved by updating the personal access token with the correct permissions under your github account

Hi guys,

If you guys are a confused on the instructions to add your organisation's fork to CodeCov:

1. Sign up to CodeCov
2. Enable Github Actions on your fork
3. Make a trivial commit to your fork (This runs the CI/CD workflow which uploads a report to CodeCov)
4. CodeCov should have detected your fork!

I took a embarrassing amount of time figuring this out. So hopefully this useful to some of you :)

I've used the checkstyle.xml file provided by SE-EDU but have noticed some of the configured rules are either overly strict or aren't fully in line with their stated conventions.

I've taken an attempt at modifying the rules file and made the following changes:

**1. Allow abbreviations for constants (final variables)**
```Java
final int COLOR_RED;  // Now will not produce abbreviation error
```
**2. Disable end-of-line operatorWrap checks**
```Java
int number = reallyLongFunctionName()
            + anotherFunctionName();  //No OperatorWrap error, might be needed to break long lines of code
```
**3. Modified CustomImportOrder** 
Original import sequence
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList; //Standard imports
import java.util.List;

import org.abc.module; //Followed by imports starting with "org"

import com.abc.module; //Then imports starting with "com"

import duke.Ui; //Followed by every other import clumped together
import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
```
New import sequence
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList; //Standard imports
import java.util.List;

import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane; //Third-party imports
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;

import duke.Ui; //Duke imports
```

I'm not sure if I'm unknowingly breaking any of the stated conventions, so let me know if I am 😃 .
If not, feel free to [try out the configuration yourselves](https://github.com/bryanwee023/ip/blob/f0c31c453f125fa647734cc8339490b84133fcb9/config/checkstyle.xml)! Let me know if there are bugs or more edits that can be made.

Hi guys, just my 2 cents.

I mostly agree with @pss-coder argument. However, I think exceptions should not always be checked by the client. This could break the spirit of encapsulation. As a client of a package, I am not expected to know the constructor's logic or why errors are thrown. 

Hence, in cases where possible exceptions are closely coupled to logic unimportant to the client, exception checking can be handled by a factory method, as suggested by @yucheng11122017.

Although, I wonder if using factory methods for trivial cases could unnecessarily fatten the interface. I mean it's also not common to find Java classes with constructors that throw exceptions (e.g. `java.io.File`) 🤷 .

@damithc oh, the phrasing must have thrown me off.

Perhaps it will be better to merge the last 2 sentences?

I interpreted the last sentence as a standalone step 😅 .

Details:
> "TreeWalker is not allowed as a parent of LineLength Please review 'Parent Module' section for this Check in web documentation if Check is standard." - intellij error message
- Reference doc: [github forum](https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea/issues/458)
- So I know the issue (_TreeWalker component shouldnt be parent of LineLength component_) but I'm quite tentative to change it cos I don't think we're suppose to change the checkstyle.xml, just import it wholesale? Also, if I was to change it, I also don't know what to change it to 😢 

Context:
- just setup Gradle and copied over .xml checkstyle
- was using JDK 15, now swapped back to JDK 11
- Gradle run, build works (if I comment out `id 'checkstyle'` & the checkstyle block)
- I had a previous issue with _unable to Instantiate FileContentHolder_ error but followed [link](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/issues/5132) to just comment out the message. Supposedly, its due to the upgraded version of checkstyle.

Relevant Code:
```xml
<module name="TreeWalker">

&gt;!-- Required for SuppressionCommentFilter to work -->
&gt;!--    <module name="FileContentsHolder"/>-->

... other code

Hi Han Ming, thanks for the advice :)

Agreed that I shouldn't be too worried on having to change files, but was concerned cos no one else reported this issue although everyone should have copied over the exact same checkstyle file. So in all likelihood the problem is me.

Anyhow faced a few issues before this and commented them out as per some stackoverflow comments. After shifting the LineLength up i faced yet another 4/5 issued on deprecated properties and I kinda give up commenting them out (cos who knows how many more there are). 

Will probably leave out the checkstyle now and come back to it later if I have time, thanks for the advice nonetheless.
If anyone knows how to get it to work without changing the code please lemme know :).

Maybe you can change `import org.junit.Test;` to `import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;`?

Or maybe another answer in the stackoverflow post would help for your problem.

Hi everyone! I encountered test failure when running runtest.sh. However, my output for EXPECTED.TXT and ACTUAL.TXT appears to be the same. I have already fixed the trailing whitespace issues in intellij as suggested by issue #34. 

I have tried running "cp ACTUAL.txt EXPECTED.txt" to copy the exact content over and the test failure can be solved. 

Attached is a screenshot of change occurred before and after I run "cp ACTUAL.txt EXPECTED.txt".

Just wondering what is the issue here and how to solve it. Any help appreciated!

Actually along this thought, we should also try to exit javafx cleanly (disable textfield and button, set textfield text to "exiting..." to indicate the disabled textfield and button is not a bug, and disable the enter key from doing anything after user sent bye command, otherwise unintended behaviour may occur.

Leaving this here because I initially thought it was a strange bug in the checkstyle file, in case anyone faces the same issue:

Depending on your settings, Intellij might automatically add some indentation when you hit enter to create a blank line. This will be picked up by checkstyle as trailing whitespace, but the intellij settings wouldnt allow you to have a blank line without having the indent.

For example:
```java
foo() {
    ...
} // line a

bar() {
...
```
The line after a will be automatically indented, which causes a trailing whitespace error to be picked up, but when you go to that line and hit backspace it clears the whole line and you no longer have a space between foo and bar.

To disable this feature just go to preferences -&gt; editor -&gt; general -&gt; smart keys and set `unindent on backspace` to `to nearest indent position`

Hi, I've faced the same problem as you. I found [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15723240/java-whats-the-difference-of-double-clicking-and-running-from-terminal-for-op). I actually tried troubleshooting but if i recall correctly the only solution that worked (file found for both double click and command line) was to make it such that the file to read from / write to is in the user's home dir and nowhere else, which in my opinion isn't really much of a fix... 

I personally still haven't found a solution to this and now my jar wont run on double click at all so thats another thing i have to fix

Hey, after managing to locate the file created from double click were you able to make it such that double click ran the same way as running from the terminal? if so how did you do it?

Edit: (For anyone still monitoring this thread) I managed to get it to work by giving the java launcher full disk access, you can find out how to do so in [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252709578) post. 

Essentially the jar has restricted disk read / write permissions when running on double click, so it cant create anything but a temporary file in the middle of nowhere. On the other hand running via terminal gives the jar permission to read / write since it is 'piggybacking' on the permissions that the terminal has as well. Changing permissions of the java launcher removes this need for piggybacking.

I ran into this similar issue earlier and what worked for me was to manually write down all the import statements in the file that has the `public static void main(String[] args)` function.

ie instead of:
```

```

do:
```
import main.java.Engine;

There shouldn't be any need to edit the original .bat file, unless your Java's version is different from IntelliJ's java version. In that case, it is an issue with PATH instead.

Like @xlzior mentioned, fast-forwarding makes your git history cleaner, and in a way prevents unnecessary commits. In the context of this module, I think the main disadvantage would be because when looking at the Git history, fast-forwarded merges won't look like separate branches, making it more difficult for us and the teaching team to track our changes.

When Executing into the gradle task, some would get the error `Could not find or load main class seedu.duke.Duke`. In order to fix this, there would have to mention the package of your Duke class in the build.gradle file.

In this file, the main class name has to be changed from 
```gradle
application {
    mainClassName = "seedu.duke.Duke"
}
```

to 

```gradle
application {
    mainClassName = "duke.Duke"
}
```
or the package of your main duke class.

Hope this helps!

I'm guessing this is because your Duke class takes in a String parameter as an argument. 

One solution is to overload the Duke class with a constructor that requires no parameters. 

If you would want to use your Duke constructor which takes in a parameter, you can refer to the third solution with 8 upvotes in the link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24611789/how-to-pass-parameters-to-javafx-application). Your code should look similar to the snippet below. Hope this helps!

Hi, I managed to find the problem. Apparently I was running the tests under my 'test' module instead of my root module.

A small pop up appears briefly upon running the tests each time, and clicking on it has allowed the tests to be run under the root module and solved my problem.

Thank you!

For week 3 i think we are supposed to follow a workflow as follows:
do changes in 7, do changes in 8, go to master, merge 7, tag 7, merge 8, tag 8, push master push branches push tags
but i did something along the lines of:
changes in 7, push to branch 7, changes in 8, push to branch 8, go to master merge 7 and 8, push master, push tags.
is this considered acceptable and if not how am i supposed to undo it (or do it correctly)?

I personally feel that prefixing `get` in your case here may be a bit misleading since we usually associate `getX` with getters, which are methods returning field `X` from the instance.

Since you are kind of formatting a string in the method, I think that using "format" as the verb here would be appropriate. 

Additionally, `outOfBoundsString` sounds like it is the string that is out-of-bounds, but actually it is the `index` that is out-of-bounds.

I would suggest `formatIndexOutOfBoundsString`, but since the strings are actually messages to be displayed to the user, how about `formatIndexOutOfBoundsMessage`?

I believe your computer ran the software from a different directory. Suppose you:
1. Put your `Duke.jar` on Desktop
2. Open Terminal where the directory is at `~`
3. Run `java -jar Desktop/Duke.jar`
The data folder/file will be created at `~` instead of `Desktop`.

I think something similar might have happened when you double click the jar file. You could perhaps check you home directory?

Could also consider `ls -a` to see the folder is somehow hidden.

If I reuse a piece of code from another current student, I have to credit them. Makes sense, Fair enough.
But can I confirm that in the credit format according to the following article found in the Admin section of the module website, the _{yourGithubUsername}_ stands for the GitHub username of the source and not me (the person reusing it)?

If you did step 4 `Manually create a .java file in File Explorer (outside IntelliJ IDEA) by creating a text file and change its extension (.txt)` it might be possible that it is red because the file is not tracked by git yet.

I managed to setup Gradle and run my application as per level `A-Gradle`, however when I try to run 
`gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` and `gradlew clean build` the following error happens.

I'm going to close the issue. The issue was that I was using Java SDK 15, which is incompatible with gradle 6.2. The project settings strangely does not affect the Terminal's java version. You have to point the environment PATH variable in Settings > Terminal > Environment variables to the correct Java SDK version for this to work.

Hi! Both my branch-A-Assertions and branch-A-CodeQuality are not detected on the iP progress dashboard, and it has been a few days since they have been pushed to my fork. I have also managed to complete all of this week's tasks and they all show up as tracked on the iP progress dashboard.

In addition, I have also tried locally merging my master branch into branch-A-Assertions and branch-A-CodeQuality last night (after completing BCD-Extension) before pushing them to my fork again. However, the most recent update of the iP progress dashboard still does not detect them.

Could anyone provide some help?

Hi everyone,

I successfully managed to create a jar file. However, upon trying to run by double-clicking the file, there was no response.

I then tried to run the file from the terminal but was met with this error.

It seems like there's an issue with the Image object in my MainWindow class,  
```java
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Input stream must not be null
```
Though I did not make any changes to the code provided in the tutorial.

I could not import anything related to junit and even when I tried to create a new Test file by using IntelliJ's in built auto test creator, the new Test file was not created in the allocated duke test file and was created in the same path as the class that I was meant to test.

I tried to delete and rewrite import statements of junit packages as well as duke classes but they do not even light up as suggestions when I type half of it and it still cannot be found. 
If anyone can help me I would be very appreciative thank you!

@VimuthM Thank you for your suggestion but it seems that editing the ```Path``` isn't enough to solve the problem in my case.
After following your recommended post, I found another [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22381202/a-jni-error-has-occurred-please-check-your-installation-and-try-again-in-eclips) and uninstalled Java JRE 8 [manually from the Control Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98), restarted my computer, then it worked :D So, as long as ```java -version``` and ```javac -version``` give the same version, the problem is solved.

I was adding Gradle support and added the `add-gradle-support` branch. Then I couldnt push it using SourceTree because "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind", even though there shouldn't be any updates. I merged back to master and pushed but SourceTree still did not allow me to do so. Then, I do not know what I did, but I managed to push it. But it got pushed to the original iP repository by Prof Damith, and it wasn't pushed to my forked repository.

This is how my SourceTree look like now.

Hello, I need some help regarding generating a new JAR file for this week's iP.

I referred to the Gradle tutorial that was linked in the description of the task. I tried to delete the `'.idea` file and ran `shadow jar` multiple times. Still, my `.jar` is &gt; 10MB. It runs as expected on my machine but I feel it probably won't on someone else's system if they dont have `javafx`. 

Any help would be appreciated! 😃 

Thank you!

It is 8.7MB in size. I have referred to #205 and I think it might be due to the size of my images.

Just to add on, the NoSuchMethodException should disappear if you just add the empty constructor to your main class (e.g. Duke.java) so that you have 2 constructors, don't have to delete your existing constructor 😉

Hello, if you are worried about the readability in the switch statement, wrapping everything into a method to handle that particular case would be very useful. For example, for case Done command, I would have a one-liner handleDone(..) method. 
Others reading your code will be able to easily understand the purpose of the switch at a glance, and refer to the method if they need to see the implementation.

At this current point in our chat bot, we handle exceptions by printing a custom message and continue accepting input. 

Given that the way of handling exceptions is the same for all DukeExceptions, is there any added benefit to creating multiple specific exceptions (e.g. TaskIndexOutOfBoundsException or MissingParamsException) that extend DukeExceptions? On the other hand, is passing the string to be printed as argument through DukeException more scalable? (Since there wouldn't be a need to create new Exception classes each time we implement a new feature)

It doesn't really matter when you push as what you are doing when you push is just updating the copy on GitHub with your local copy. And yep, when you do a `git push` you are pushing to your remote branch on GitHub (you can check which branch you are on using `git status`).

My 2 🪙 :  
Merge conflicts will be inevitable in a branching workflow. However, I believe there are ways to minimise them:
1. Good code design and separation of concerns. UI and data storage shouldn't be mangled together, for example. You can split features into various modules, and have each member work on their own modules without having to worry too much about conflicts.
2. Planning and management of project. Plan ahead and assign distinct tasks to each member, with the goal of minimising the dependency/interconnectedness of separate tasks/issues.
3. Good development practices such as clear communication between members. Everyone should have some idea what the others are doing. This is one reason for regular scheduled meetings where everyone can discuss and see what others are working on. If 2 or more people need to work on similar parts of the code, they should communicate between themselves to ensure minimal conflicts.
4. PRs should be small and focused as much as possible. Generally speaking, if your PR is getting too big (>1k LoC for example), you may want to take a step back and figure out if you can split this up into smaller PRs that are more targeted. Don't try to introduce many, unrelated changes into one PR that affects code from all over the codebase. Furthermore, smaller and more focused PRs are easier to follow and reason about, and hence easier to review.

What I described above is an ideal scenario. Of course, there are times where nasty conflicts are inevitable, such as major refactoring where you are moving files about or modifying files all over the codebase as part of the refactoring. However, those cases are (hopefully) more rare, and a heads up should be given to the whole team when such a major change is happening so that they won't be caught off guard.

Regarding,
> Should B pull from remote to check for updates in master? Or just concentrate and finish their work?

Personally, I will `pull` frequently. Changes made in `master` should be (mostly) finalised, so no matter how long you delay fixing the merge conflicts, you will still have to fix them when you make ur PR. The problem with putting it off is if you are not updated on what's happening in master, you may diverge even further and create even more conflicts unknowingly, leaving you with a massive mess and headache at the very end. So to avoid 'fun' surprises (especially before deadlines), I will lean towards resolving conflicts ASAP.

> If B should pull, what if B only wants to pick some changes from the updated master, not everything?

I believe you can use `git cherry-pick` to do that, although I will personally just pull all the changes (for reason mentioned above).

Since the GUI is specifically for Duke, and iP isn't going to require applying the GUI to different models in the same project, it would make sense to put the GUI classes into a supackage of `duke` like `duke.ui`?

I am not very sure but I think a tag cannot have the same name as another branch. I could not push my commit in a branch to remote because I have a tag of the same name in remote already, after deleting the tag I was able to push. Did you by any chance name one of your branch as Level-8?

I think assertions are important in helping software engineers like us to find bugs in the project that can occur due to our own mistake. Even if there are no errors now, some changes in the future might introduce new errors (regression bugs).

Use assertions to validate invariants, which are conditions that will always be the same regardless of the input, when the method is called and other states of the program.

However, assertions should not be used when you would expect some other exceptions to be thrown, such as when the user inputs the wrong command.

Hi, maybe you can try running the suggested `--stacktrace` option to get more useful information.

Now that we've implemented a GUI for Duke, should we be using the previous iteration of CLI for any testing / etc?

In my **build.gradle** file, my mainClassName is "duke.Launcher". I followed the instructions and included a main method in my Launcher class:

``` Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(Duke.class, args);
    }
```

While the GUI works fine, when I want to test the CLI through my main method in ```Duke.java```, I get a ```Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```. 

Only upon changing my main method in the Launcher class to the following, does the CLI run: 

``` Java
public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        Application.launch(Duke.class, args);
        Duke duke = new Duke("data/tasks.txt");
        duke.run();

Is there a better way to simultaneously run the CLI and GUI? Or is this a wrong methodology altogether? Thank you!

Hi Alard, do you mind sharing what were the steps you went through (commands that you used) to add the gradle files (build.gradle, gradlew, gradle.bat)? And when you said that you tried cloning from your repo, did you also just clone from your latest commit?

@eezj35 I think you are referring to [Week 2's textbook content](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/schedule/week2/topics.html#quality-assurance-testing-test-automation-automated-testing-of-cli-applications).

Hi, when trying to build my JAR file from Gradle using '>gradle build' after running '>gradle clean', I keep getting this error despite all my Java versions in my compiler build Java 11 (following the project structure). 

If it helps, I'm using MacOS 15, IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.1 (Community Edition) and my output for the following in terminal:

```
java --version
openjdk 11.0.9.1 2020-11-04
OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.9.1+1, mixed mode)

javac --version
javac 11.0.9.1
```

The error message when I try to run the jar file is as follows:

```
   Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.launcher.Launcher
        java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: duke/launcher/Launcher has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 60.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0

I encountered a similar problem. You may want to check the Gradle JVM in setting (change it to project sdk solved my problem)

Thanks for the quick solution prof, I also faced this issue. However, while most of the programme appears to be fixed, the help file is still not fixed.
