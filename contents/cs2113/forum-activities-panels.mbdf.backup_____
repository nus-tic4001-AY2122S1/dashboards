Hi folks, [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) will begin in 20 days. Since we will be working on a team and making many pull requests in this module, you might as well join the event. All you need to do is to label your repository with the `hacktoberfest` topic and create 4 new pull requests. Of course you can also do an individual pull request to public repositories. This way you can experience first-hand and learn more about the open source community. Btw, the first 55,000 participants can earn a free T-shirt. üòù

Yes, &gt;code>System.out.println(scores.length);&gt;/code> prints 4, because you initialized &gt;code>scores&gt;/code> as an array of size 4. Java has 0-based indexing so an array of size 4 will start from index 0 to 3 (i.e. scores[0] until scores[3] is valid).

The line &gt;code>scores[5] = 0;&gt;/code> throws the following error message during runtime (not compile-time).

There are several ways to push tags, each for different situations.

I ran `diff output.txt ACTUAL.txt | cat -t` on my terminal.
Note: `output.txt` is my output, and the option `-t` will cause `cat` to show any special characters.

There seems to be two grouping methods adopted by most programmer, either grouping by functionality or scope/accessibility.

From what I can find..
* [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-fileorganization.html) seems to prefer grouping methods based on functionality rather than by scope/accessibility.
* [Robert C. Martin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1760877) advises programmers to organize their member variables at the top of the class (constants first, then private members).
* Sun Microsystems' Java Coding Style Guide has very rigid organization. See [Section 6.1](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.443.7443&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

 Whichever one that you end up choosing, I think it is important to be consistent. Not sure if there is any specific requirement from this module though.

From what I can gather, `System.lineSeparator()` returns the system-dependent line separator string. Using it makes the code more portable, as shown by someone [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23707024). I guess the implementation is most apparent/useful when dealing with obscure non-standard OS? Which is why it was designed as a method instead.

One question though, is it a good practice to replace every `\n` with `System.lineSeparator()`? For example,

```java
// Is this ok?
String s = "Hello, World!\n";

// Or is this better?
String s = "Hello, World!" + System.lineSeparator();

Sometimes we just want to focus on the main logic of the program and forget about exceptions. However, since Java uses checked exceptions, you are forced to deal with them, otherwise your code will not compile. However, doing this..

```java
try {
  // your code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // do nothing
}
```

is a horrible idea. Since `Exception` is the superclass of all exceptions, everything will get silently ignored! And it will be difficult to figure out later on if something is wrong with your code.

This practice is such a notoriously bad practice that there is a name for it -- [The Pokemon Exception Handling](https://wiki.c2.com/?PokemonExceptionHandling).

This is slightly better than swallowing all the exceptions. But by doing this, you are unable to handle them properly. For example, your code can catch both `FileNotFoundException` and `NullPointerException`, but you will probably want your program to react to them differently by using multiple `catch` blocks. Generally, the rule of thumb is to catch all the exceptions that you **expect**. So if you managed to catch something that you didn't expect, it is most definitely an indication that your code is buggy.

For the last question in Coursemology, is there something wrong final test case output in the system? Mainly the "total in local currency..." being on a new line, as the one shown in the CS2113 Website is different from coursemo.

 Hi Sir,

I noticed that we would need to use tags in our future pushes to git. Hence i'm trying it out right now to clarify my understanding. Can I ask, what is the difference between the option of "Working copy parent" & "Specified commit"? 

I only understand that the latter attaches a tag to a specific commit, but what does the former do?

Hi Guys,

I think i know the issue. I believe it's mainly due to the formatting of my float output. When the total value is 0, it prints out as "0.0" when the system is expecting "0.00". This can easily be fixed by using `System.out.printf(...)` instead of using `System.out.println(...)`

FC gave me no difference in output. The only main difference i can find is that my actual output ends off at the next line cause i'm using `println(...)` to output. Aside from that, both the FC command and myself can't seem to spot any difference in the outputs.

> In this test case, there is a new line (\n) after the last print output (16), so using println() should be fine for producing the correct output. My suggestion is to check if you have too many new lines after the last print output (there should be only one \n). You may also want to check if there is extra space before or after each of your print outputs (in each line). As our friends mentioned above, these differences are hard to catch. The test case for this question checks strictly if your standard output matches the sample output, so one extra space will be considered "different".

I've double checked my output multiple times. (I've attached the output txt file below). I suspect it might be due to some compile error? But I'm not sure what might be causing it. The code in Coursemo is 100% the same as the code in my compiler.

I tried both `println(...)` and `print(... \n)`. none of them passed the test case.

A quick google said to use `System.lineSeperator()` as this will provide you with whatever the current system is using.

Hi all,

The issue has been resolve. The main issue was that Coursemo was searching for the function `area()` in my code but i had created another function called `getArea()` to perform the task of `area()`. As such, Coursemo treated as though my code was incorrect.

If such is the case, in the context of this module, is it still ok to continue to use `println` or do I have to change all `println` to `print(... + System.lineSeparator())`?

My solution to that was to use

```
try {
  // your code
} catch (Exception e) {
  print("Error :" + e)

```
As this would allow the user/me to still know what error is thrown. Or if need be, there is the `e.printStackTrace()` that would show which line it is at.

## tP Idea
Given a hectic schedule for many investors and traders, our tP product aims to provide them with a simple CLI software to store the instruments they are following or wanting to open a trade in.

## Proposed API usage
[Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/)
Given the frequently changing nature of market prices and other financial data, it is important that our product also provides real-time financial data to the user. Therefore, we would like to use the data provided by Finnhub API.

## Purpose
The API provides many crucial financial data like the current market price, company profile, etc. The full list of functionalities can be found in the documentation: https://finnhub.io/docs/api/introduction . We will incorporate only the necessary data into our code.

## License

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on ChatBot Customization**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2122S1/forum/issues/18" expanded>

Hi, I understand that there is a clause which reads "customize the chatbot name, command/display formats, and even the personality of the chatbot to make your chatbot unique." under Level-1 iP for Week 3. But is this customization only limited to Level-1 or is it also allowed for future Levels/commits.

As of now, I have programmed my chatbot in such a way that it switches between Echo mode and Add task mode when the user types in "change". Likewise, at start up when the chatbot greets, it also asks the user which mode they would like to enter. Are such customizations allowed or will they be marked down by the grading scripts since particular keywords like "change", or "1" / "2" for the modes, change the way my chatbot functions, which I am guessing the grading scripts will not take into account?

Good day prof. Thanks for your speedy reply on the issue. My team has re-evaluated our need for an API and we have concluded that we can proceed forward with our tP idea even without the API data. As in, our product idea has been tweaked to remove the need for real-time data. We decided that it is better to have the user to input all the data s/he wants to monitor through our CLI programme instead of trying to incorporate the Finnhub API.

The reasons for retreating our proposal for an API:
1) This component only value-adds to our feature but that does not necessarily contribute to higher marks, since the objective of the tP is to assess the fitting in of all product features, how well value proposition and target user needs were met. Hence, my teammates felt that we can still do well and have our tP meet our value proposition without real-time API.
2) Unnecessary work involved in parsing the data for the small number of information fields we need in comparison to the large amount of data the API provides.
3) Concerns raised by teammates about the uncertainty of future tP demands/deliverables and possibility of the constraints of the Finnhub API interfering with our ability to do well in unit testing and other related assessments.
4) Some team members are not confident with the http protocols and coding out a http client in Java.

> In case you cannot use Finnhub, you can take a look at alternative like [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) as it seems to support academic usage. The free membership kinda sucks though because you are limited to 5 requests per minute. Not sure if this is compatible with Gradle so have to check with @okkhoy as well.

Hi Richard, thanks for your input. Alphavantage was the initial API we were relying on actually. To circumvent the 5 requests per minute, our team tried cycling the API token key in between 4 possible keys, switching from one key to another every 3 requests made. However, that idea didn't work and we were still able to have 5 reqs/min. Our TA advised us that this will be a hindarance later on when unit testing. So that's why we proposed Finnhub instead.

Hi, Prof. 

The iP description of week 5 section 3 (Add Increment: `A-Packages`) specifies:

To my understanding, `branch-A-Packages` should not be a requirement, and it was not included in the iP progress dashboard last week. However, when I check the dashboard again today, there is `branch-A-Packages` in the Admin tasks and there are a lot of students having this task overdue.

Hi Shi,

You can pass arguments to your program by selecting `Edit Configurations...` from the `Run` menu or the `Main` dropdown in the navigation bar (next to the `run` button). You can also right-click on the editor and select `Modify Run Configuration...`.

A new window should pop out like this.

Good to know that you solved the problem @DuckWillow.

For your question, @SuibianP provided a very good answer regarding passing conmmand-line arguements. For example, I have a simple `Test.java` file like this:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

After compiling, if I run `$ java Test arguments with whitespace`, the content printed to the terminal will be `arguments` only. However, if I run `$ java Test "arguments with whitespace"` or `$ java Test 'arguments with whitespace'`, then `arguments with whitespace` will be printed.

Furthermore, as you ask about the way Java reads your **inputs**, you should differentiate between _inputs_ and _command-line arguements_. To read inputs, we can use the`Scanner` class, which I think we will learn in the following weeks. More information can be found in the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html). Geeksforgeeks also has a very good [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ways-to-read-input-from-console-in-java/) about this.

I think the rendering on Coursemology is slightly different and nothing wrong with the test cases.

This is the result when I run locally:

```

Expenses in overseas currency:[]
Total in local currency: $0.00

And it passes all the test cases.

Firstly, don't compile the chatbot with javac. Doing so will create `.class` files in the `out/production/ip/` directory, and we don't want to push those files to GitHub. Build and run your program with IntelliJ instead.

After building with IntelliJ, the `.class` file(s) can be found at `out/production/ip/*.class`, and the `/out/` directory is included the `.gitignore` file.

```
# IDEA files
/.idea/
/out/
/*.iml
```

Therefore, the `.class` file(s) will not be pushed to the remote repo, which means that building and running the program before pushing or not does not affect the content you push to GitHub.

You should check if there are any extra spaces/newline characters, which may be hard to detect if you build and run your program with IntelliJ. 

Compile and run your program manually with `javac` instead, feed the output to a `.txt` file (e.g. `output.txt`), write a new file of the expected output (e.g. `expected.txt`), and then compare those 2 files by `diff` on Unix-bases OS or `FC` on Windows. Doing so may also detect hidden warnings that IDEs sometimes ignore.

If all seems fine on your local machine, make sure each file on Coursemology has the same content as those on your computer.

If you have pushed every commits except the merge commit to the remote repo, simply clone the remote repo to you local machine, merge without fast-forward, and push it.

If not, since you have not pushed the commits to the remote repo, the fast-forward merge has not been detected by the grading script. You can refer to [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2389361/undo-a-git-merge-that-hasnt-been-pushed-yet) to undo that merge. In case you have pushed your fast-forward merge to the remote repo, you can refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14308580/undo-a-fast-forward-merge) to restore the commits.

Basically, they are the same. The second line uses a diamond operator `&gt;>`, which is an example of type inference. Java can infer that `listOfTasks` should be an instance of `LinkedList&gt;Task>` since the compile-time type of `listOfTasks` is `LinkedList&gt;Task>`.

You can refer to the [CS2030S website](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2021-s2/24-inference.html) for more details.

Thank you for your help. I realised that I had not pushed anything to master after creating the new branch and had been pushing to the remote branch-Level-5 while working on this week's increment. Hence, I used the "git reset --hard origin/master" command to reset my local master branch to be the same as the remote master branch, then merged with the local branch-Level-5 without fast forward.

Prof will the auto grader only grade the commits that we've tagged appropriately. For example, I pushed a commit tagged Level-1 with code showing the echo function working properly. Later I push another commit tagged Level-2 with ONLY the add and list function working. 

Or do I have to show both level 1 and 2 functions working together when I push the level 2 code? Because that will take a bit more time to make sure they integrate and work properly.

Understood sir. The reason why I asked is the integration takes time and in the interest of the deadline for the tasks, I wanted to know if this allowed.

So, just to clarify - for the iP tasks required to be checked by the auto grader, we can submit code that only displays the functionality required from the level. But we can continue to work on integrating everything separately to be later reviewed by the tutor during the tutorial?

On that note, do we have to show the code directly to the TA during the tutorial or will he pull it from our fork?

The automated UI testing works fine. 

However, after I place my `Task` class and subclasses into a `duke.task` package, running the _runtest.bat_ file gives back the error message

 _"error: package duke.task does not exist"_.

How should I configure the _runtest.bat_ file so that it will compile the files within the `duke.task` package as well (I think this is the cause of the issue). I can't seem to get it to work after many tries

Hi there prof Akshay,

For our tP, our group had decided on developing a Chess command-line game. While we're all excited about the project, we're also nervous because looking at other teams (past and present), no one has attempted such a project. One of the issues we're facing is with regards to the AI and we were wondering if it would be possible for us to use stockfish (https://stockfishchess.org/) as an external dependency. Given that SF is written in C++ though, we would compile the program and pipe the commands and responses from our java application to and from the program. This could lead to dependency issues as we might not be able to test our program on Mac. There are other open-source AIs that are written in java, but they are mostly obscure git projects (https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo) and it could raise some questions on whether we 'plagerised' their code because if we're trying to understand how their AI works, we'd have to understand their OOP. Hence Stockfish would be better in this sense as it would be a 'black box' we use as our AI. We were thinking of making the first iteration something along the lines of PvP on a single console but we realised that the project requirement is 'Constraint-Single-User' Also, given that the tP requirement of fulfilling an iP worth of code for every individual is somewhat obscure, we would like to seek your opinion on whether it would be advisable to pursue this project? Also. we aren't opposed to possibly coding our own AI function (something we aren't opposed to learning more about). But we're unsure if we'd get any marks for the whole AI component.

If we can't get an approval for an AI library and we wouldn't get any marks for an AI implementation, is it too late to change our project?

Sorry, this might not be very useful but I have experienced a similar issue and what I found out was that runtest.bat was running an outdated version of Duke (the version before I divided all the files into packages), maybe you could post your runtest.bat?

However, as you can see in the image the previous Duke was not deleted and it stayed there so when I ran `java Duke`  the outdated version ran instead of the one divided into packages/folders

        `at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1651)`
        `at Duke.main(Duke.java:11)`

    String[] input = line.nextLine().split(" ", 2);
    switch (input[0]) {

```
Input.txt is as below
`todo fly`
`deadline fall /by 2pm` 
`bye` 

The ACTUAL.TXT produced stops after the first input line, which is "todo fly". Am I using scanner wrong? Thanks in advance

Hello All who have taken time to read.

It turns out that putting the Scanner creation line within the loop was causing the problem. The solution was to move it out of the loop. I hope no one else spends 3 hours trying to deal with this too üëç .

Hi all

I'm running into an issue when trying to update the text-ui testing. For some reason, when using the automated testing, some exceptions are not being caught and are stopping the program. But when I run the same input on command line, responds correctly.

Here is the code for the try-catch:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969598-632571c3-77ce-4178-a9d6-41cf56c9f510.png)

Just in the case where the input is "done" where the entry number is missing:
Running on command line and manually putting in the input works and gets the correct response:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969616-7d2b8843-af2b-48e2-b915-1b02c033ce10.png)

but running the automated testing with just "done" in input.txt:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69444734/132969657-cca25a0c-0f07-4f86-800e-6ae7f117cf17.png)
The exception that causes the program to stop should have been caught by the catch block, as it does when manually input. 

Any ideas what's going wrong? Other try-catch blocks work both with manual and automated testing. Only this block seems to have problems.

Thanks!

I forgot to tick the box for merging without fast-forward and therefore my branches don't appear in my fork, is there a way to undo this and start again?

Hi, prof. I try to use sourcetree and terminal to push the src file to github but it fails. When I pull in terminal, it shows that git refusing to merge unrelated histories and cannot merge the untracked files. I created a new branch 'upsteam' and push to the github, but cannot tag it. May i ask can you provide the whole detailed method like windows which is about how to push to github using Mac? It is really difficult to solve this problem.

I am new to coursemology. When submitting my code for the first question on coursemogoly, I accidentally clicked "finalise my submission" and I cannot have access to the following questions anymore. I wonder whether it is possible to have a new submission.

For windows, you may try to use the .msi file. It automatically helps you config your system's java PATH. You can find the .msi file

Hi, I faced a similar problem too. I did not know there were multiple questions and finalised my submission after answering only question 1. Is there anything I can do to have another chance?

To add onto his question, what would be considered as fine? Based on the strong recommendation in Level-1 to personalise the chatbot, I've changed it's name, the logo, and the wording for most of the phrases it uses. 

Hence, the fluff surrounding the overall product is very unique. However, the main functionality remains the same. Would that be okay?

I accidentally merged branch 'master' into branch-Level-5, when we were supposed to merge branch-Level-5 into 'master'. Is there any way I can salvage or rectify this? Would appreciate any advice, thanks!

I think it is because of the initialisation of the array shape to size 100, when you run the first for loop, it gives an error because not all 100 spaces are used, whereas the second for loop you are iterating through the array with data (Circle and Rectangle) stored when you addShape instead of the whole array.

I just fixed this issue as well. Try going under finder->go->library if u cant find the library try pressing command + shift + . to see hidden files. Go under application support then find Source tree. Delete all files with "@" this essentially removes any auth or password memory to github from source tree. Then create a personal access token in ur github account. Go under settings->developer settings-> personal access tokens and generate a new token. Copy and paste ur token id somewhere and this will be ur new password to github. Then follow as the video shows and add ur new account in Sourcetree with ur password being this new id. U must do this before pushing and it should work.

@okkhoy Hello prof. I have a question regarding customization as well. In my ChatBot, for adding items to the list, for example adding the item 'lunch', my code requires the user to input 'add lunch' instead of 'lunch' to add to the list. Is this allowed?

It is an excellent practice to add comments from the start of any project, not only for others to understand, but for you too!
However, I believe its implementation is officially taught to us on Week 7.

Do we have to compile the chatbot using javac each time we push to github?

Hi, I am facing the same issue. The output on my IDE is identical to the one expected but coursemology is refusing to accept the answer.
